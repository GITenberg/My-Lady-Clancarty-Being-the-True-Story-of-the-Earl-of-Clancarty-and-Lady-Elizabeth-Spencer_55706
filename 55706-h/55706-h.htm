CHAPTER I</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">&#8220;ROSEEN DHU&#8221;</p>


<p class="drop-cap2">LADY BETTY shaded her eyes with
her hand and looked out on the rose
garden of Althorpe.</p>

<p>At her feet the lawn was close clipped and
green; beyond was a garland of many colors,
roses by hundreds and tens of hundreds, the
warmth and glow of the sun upon them;
behind them, the long avenue of limes and
beeches, and between the trees vistas of level
land with the deer moving to and fro.</p>

<p>The butterflies&mdash;a little host of them&mdash;whirled
under the window, and her ladyship
smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Alice,&#8221; she said, &#8220;&#8217;tis too fair a
day to linger indoors. Bring your lute, girl,
and we&#8217;ll sing one of those dear Irish ballads
where none may hear it, to carp and scold,&mdash;none,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
indeed, but the rooks and butterflies, or
perchance the roses. What sayst thou, Alice,
may not a rose hear sweet sounds when it exhales
such sweet perfume?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know not, madam,&#8221; replied her handmaid
soberly, as she laid aside her needlework
and reached for her lute; &#8220;but sometimes,
truly, I think &#8217;twould be well if ears were
fewer in this world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, or tongues more gentle,&#8221; assented
Lady Betty laughing, as she stepped out of
the window to the lawn, followed by her
attendant.</p>

<p>Both were young girls, but youth and the
rosy comeliness of youth sat more lightly on
the handmaid Alice, whose simple face and
figure suggested nothing more subtle than the
virtue and homely wisdom of a country girl.
It was quite different with Lady Betty Clancarty,
the daughter of the Earl of Sunderland
and the maiden wife of an Irish peer. There
was a slight pensiveness to her beauty, for
beautiful she was; yet there were times when
the gayety of a vivacious spirit broke through
all restraints, and she was the light-hearted,
witty girl that nature had intended her to be.
Her eyes&mdash;beautiful eyes they were, too,&mdash;were
large, clear and sparkling with spirit, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the soft tints of her complexion and the glossy
waves of her dark hair combined to make a
charming picture, far more human and bewitching,
indeed, than her own portrait from the
brush of Lely, hanging in the great gallery at
Althorpe. The pensiveness of her expression
showed only when her face was in repose;
when she smiled the sun shone through the
cloud. Her figure was gracefully tall in its
gown of white dimity flowered with pink,
the neck dressed open with falls of lace, and
the full sleeves loose and flowing at the elbow.</p>

<p>She moved lightly and swiftly across the
lawn, one white hand resting on the shoulder
of her handmaid, who was shorter and fuller
in outline than her mistress. Though their
stations were thus widely sundered, a frank
girlish friendship existed between them, and
Lady Betty had few secrets that were not
shared by Alice Lynn. They had grown up
in the same household; the one child waiting
on the other on all state occasions, but usually
her playmate, after the fashion of those days
when the feudal tie of lord and vassal still
bound old servants and their descendants to
their masters. The ancestors of Alice Lynn
had borne the banner of the Despencers in
many a bloody field; she came of good yeoman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
stock, worthy of honor and trust, and she
was single-hearted in her devotion to Lady
Clancarty. They made a charming picture,
walking through winding paths and talking
freely, with little reference to their respective
stations in the great world beyond Althorpe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, the roses,&#8221; Lady Betty said, &#8220;I know
not whether I love them best in their first budding
or in their prime, or when the last few
pale blossoms struggle to unfold under wintry
skies, like our poor hearts, Alice, that need
to be warmed by the sunshine of prosperous
love. Mine should have shrivelled up long
ago&mdash;like an old dried leaf. But it has not,&#8221;
she added, smiling and laying her hand on her
bosom; &#8220;I feel it&mdash;it throbs&mdash;it is warm and
strong and whole, Alice, and yet&mdash;I am a
wife and, for aught I know, a widow too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There be many wives who would fain be
widows, I trow,&#8221; retorted Alice, bluntly, and
Lady Betty laughed gayly and lightly, the sun
shining in her lustrous eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perchance I am happy, then, in not knowing
my husband&#8217;s face,&#8221; she said; and added
musingly, &#8220;a strange fate is mine, Alice, married
at eleven and then separated forever from
my husband by a gulf as wide as&mdash;as the
infinite space; I know no stronger simile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Here am I, the daughter of a Whig peer, who
is a counsellor of King William&#8217;s, and the
sister of a burning Whig&mdash;for Spencer is on
fire, I am sure&mdash;and yet I am the wife, the
wedded wife, of an Irish rebel and Jacobite;
an outlaw from his country and a stranger even
to me. What a fate!&#8221; and she shook her
head with a pensive air, though a smile lurked
about her lips for, after all, she could not mourn
the absence of an unknown spouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas wrong to marry a child of such
tender years, my lady,&#8221; the handmaid said
indignantly; &#8220;to tie you up&mdash;one of the
loveliest women in England&mdash;to a&mdash;a&mdash;&#8221;
she broke off confused, catching Lady Betty&#8217;s
eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;A what, Alice?&#8221; the countess asked dryly;
&#8220;ay, I know by your blushes and confusion
that you have caught the contagion, that you
believe with Lord Spencer that my husband
is a consummate villain. But look you, my
girl, if there is one thing above another that
would make me love a man and take up his
cause, it is to find him the object of senseless
and bitter abuse. What of it if Clancarty has
not sought me? how could he? Is he not
banished from the kingdom, stripped of his
estates, and denied even his most natural and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
sacred rights?&#8221; Lady Clancarty&#8217;s eyes sparkled
with indignation. &#8220;What of it, if he is a
Jacobite and a Papist? Is he the only man
who has changed his faith? I trow not!&mdash;though
I should be the last one to say it,&#8221; and
she broke off, blushing crimson.</p>

<p>The thought of her own father&#8217;s apostasy, of
his frequent political somersaults, overwhelmed
her, and she recollected her own dignity in
time to bridle her impulsive tongue.</p>

<p>Alice was too discreet to take up the argument;
she stooped, instead, to gather some
violets, and arranged them slowly and in silence.
Lady Betty walked ahead of her to a
little rustic seat, and sitting down held out her
hand with an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give hither the violets, Alice,&#8221; she said
imperiously, &#8220;and sing me a song. I am in
as black a mood as ever Saul was, and may do
you a mischief if you do not soothe me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice smiled. &#8220;I fear you not, dear Lady
Betty,&#8221; she said, tuning her lute; &#8220;your anger
passes over as quickly as a storm-cloud in April
weather. What shall I sing you, madam?&#8221;</p>

<p>A roguish smile twinkled in Lady Clancarty&#8217;s
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall do penance, lass, and sing me
either a Papist hymn or an Irish ballad.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>&#8220;Nay, I am no Papist, but a good Protestant,&#8221;
said Alice, stiffly, &#8220;therefore it must be
an Irish ballad, which is what you really want,
my lady!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Betty laughed softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis true, my girl,&#8221; she said, clasping her
hands about her knees, the full sleeves falling
away from arms as white as milk. &#8220;I love the
ballads; whether for his sake or their own, I
know not,&#8221; and she bent her head listening as
the handmaid played the first plaintive notes
on her lute.</p>

<p>Alice was no contemptible musician, and
she touched the instrument softly with loving
fingers, playing the first sweet sad chords of
that old Irish air and Jacobite ballad, &#8220;Roseen
Dhu,&#8221; or &#8220;Dark Rosaleen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The garden and the great park beyond and
around it were quiet save for the cawing of the
hundreds of rooks that haunted those stately
avenues of trees. The warmth and the soft
murmuring of the late summer were there;
here was the deep shadow of stately groves,
yonder the wide sunshine on level lawns, but
the place was deserted save for the two young
women and the deer that were so tame that they
pressed close about them, looking through the
trees with soft brown eyes, and seeming to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
listen to the wild, plaintive notes of the ballad,
as Alice sang in a full, mellow voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">&#8220;All day long in unrest</div>
<div class="verse">To and fro do I move,</div>
<div class="verse">The very soul within my breast</div>
<div class="verse">Is wasted for you, love!</div>

<div class="verse">My life, my love, my saint of saints,</div>
<div class="indent1">My dark Rosaleen!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Midway in the song the girl paused, still
playing the air softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lady,&#8221; she said, in an undertone,
&#8220;there is some one yonder in the shrubbery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis Melissa,&#8221; replied Lady Clancarty;
&#8220;I have seen her. She loves to lurk behind a
bush, and to slip along softly as a cat upon nut-shells;
&#8217;tis her nature. Faith, I must buy her
some bells for her toes. Go on, my girl; I
care not,&#8221; she added, laughing, &#8220;and I do
love the tune. Ah, &#8216;Rosaleen, my own Rosaleen!&#8217;&#8221;
she hummed, keeping time with her
slender hand.</p>

<p>Alice sang again:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Over dews, over sands,</div>
<div class="verse">Will I fly for your weal:</div>
<div class="verse">Your holy white hands</div>
<div class="verse">Shall gird me with steel.</div>
<div class="verse">At home&mdash;in your emerald bowers,</div>

<div class="verse">My virgin flower, my flower of flowers,</div>
<div class="indent1">My dark Rosaleen!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Suddenly Lady Clancarty started and half
rose, interrupting the singer; but as Alice
looked up in alarm, she sat down again, rosy
and defiant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; she said; &#8220;go on, Alice, there
comes Spencer himself, and, forsooth, I would
not be frightened out of my pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my lady,&#8221; protested Alice, in confusion,
&#8220;he will be dreadfully angry, he always
is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure he will,&#8221; retorted Lady Betty,
with a ripple of laughter, &#8220;therefore sing, lass,
and I will sing, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice still hesitated, her eyes on the figure
of a young man who was coming swiftly
across the lawn, but her mistress stamped her
foot.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>&#8220;Sing!&#8221; she commanded so sharply that
Alice obeyed hastily, and in a moment the
countess&#8217; rich contralto joined her voice in
singing the last passionate verse of &#8220;Roseen
Dhu.&#8221;</p>

<p class="ph3">BROTHER AND SISTER</p>


<p class="drop-cap2">LORD CHARLES SPENCER paused
in the centre of the triangle.</p>

<p>&#8220;A very pretty performance,&#8221; he
said with a sneer, &#8220;a very proper performance&mdash;to
sing Jacobite ballads here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I trow they are not the first that have
been sung here, brother,&#8221; retorted Lady Betty
pertly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a saucy tongue, Elizabeth,&#8221; replied
her brother rudely, turning white rather
than red, for in this young man&#8217;s disposition
anger went white, not red. &#8220;&#8217;Twould go hard
with you if my father heard that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twould go hard with you if my father
heard <i>that</i>!&#8221; mocked Lady Betty incorrigible.
&#8220;Come, come, Charles, talk of something
agreeable. What is the volume under your
arm? Noah&#8217;s observations on droughts? or
Adam&#8217;s reflections on mothers-in-law? or Cain&#8217;s
on brotherly love? Faith, I always expect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
something profound from the most erudite
ornament of the Whig party.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I might look as certainly for discretion
in Elizabeth Spencer,&#8221; he replied with
acrimony.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Elizabeth Clancarty,&#8221; corrected the
countess, flashing an indignant glance at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are marvellously proud of that beggar&#8217;s
name,&#8221; retorted her brother, with cutting
irony.</p>

<p>Lady Clancarty&#8217;s face crimsoned with anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a hypocrite, Spencer!&#8221; she said,
stamping her foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Family insults in public are always becoming,&#8221;
said Lord Spencer, controlling himself
with an effort, but white to the lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forsooth, who began it?&#8221; recriminated his
high-spirited sister; &#8220;you might better indeed
talk of other things. Of your fine clothes, for
instance; you are truly &#8216;the glass of fashion,&#8217;
my lord, pink satin waistcoat and breeches,
gray plush coat, point of Venice ruffles, white
silk stockings, clocked, too, with pink, French
shoes and buckles,&mdash;mercy on us, sir! what
splendor for beggarly Lady Clancarty and quiet
Althorpe!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Spencer, who was indeed dressed in
the extreme of fashion, bit his lip, scowling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
darkly at Lady Betty and Alice, who remained
discreetly in the background.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do well to boast of your dishonored
name, madam,&#8221; he said coldly, &#8220;but my Lord
Sunderland intends that you shall be divorced
from that disreputable Irish rebel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what if I will not, my lord?&#8221; asked
the countess, her face blazing with defiance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a fool,&#8221; said Spencer sharply;
&#8220;happy you would be&mdash;dragged into exile by
a rake and a scapegrace&mdash;but, pshaw! what
nonsense I talk&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do, sir!&#8221; interrupted his sister defiantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense because Clancarty does not want
you.&#8221; He continued, with a provoking drawl,
&#8220;Where is your husband, my lady? Forsooth
you do not know&mdash;but I do! At
Saint Germain and at Paris; a gambler, a
rake, a cutpurse, with half a dozen lady-loves
to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; cried Lady Betty furiously, rising
in her indignation. &#8220;Shame on you, sir,
to insult a woman and she your sister, and to
blacken a gallant gentleman behind his back.
Is that your virtue? Faith, I believe a witty
rogue would be a happier companion than a
virtuous bore!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>&#8220;Your tongue will cut your throat yet,
madam,&#8221; said Spencer harshly; &#8220;you have
worked yourself into this passion; you have
never seen your husband since childhood, and
you do not know him. It is my duty as your
brother, a painful duty, I admit,&#8221; he said
pompously, &#8220;to tell you the truth. Lord
Clancarty is a notorious scamp, a dissolute fellow,
a murderer and oppressor; and, as for
you, what does he care for you? You little
fool, he has never sought you&mdash;and never
will!&#8221; and with this taunt my lord turned on
his heel and walked decorously but swiftly
away, wise enough to fly before his sister
could retaliate.</p>

<p>Lady Betty stood as he had left her for a
moment, her little hands clenched and her
face crimson.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mean hypocrite!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;to fling
it in my teeth. I vow I sometimes almost
hate Spencer&mdash;and yet he is my brother.
I&#8217;m a beast, Alice, a wretch! but oh!&#8221; and
suddenly her mood changed; she threw herself
on the garden-seat, trembling with emotion,
tears on her dark lashes. &#8220;Oh, why must I
be so cruelly insulted? &#8217;Tis true, Alice, &#8217;tis
true; Clancarty has never even cared to claim
his wife! Think of it, I&mdash;I&mdash;Betty Spencer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
scorned by an Irish Jacobite!&#8221; and she burst
into tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lady,&#8221; purred a smooth voice, as the
other attendant suddenly and softly stepped
into view, from the friendly shadow of an elm;
&#8220;be consoled, &#8217;tis even as Lord Spencer&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go!&#8221; cried the countess furiously, dashing
away her tears and stamping her foot at
Melissa. &#8220;Go! What do I want of your
consolation, you eavesdropper!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My lady, I beg pardon,&#8221; stammered the
confused waiting-woman, &#8220;I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go!&#8221; repeated the countess imperiously,
with a gesture of disdain. &#8220;When I want
you, I will summon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a look of ill-disguised anger on her
smooth face, but with an attempted air of
humility, the attendant withdrew as softly as
she had approached, and Lady Betty recalled
her dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; she said, &#8220;what a creature I am,
Alice, so to betray myself, and to stoop to
quarrel with that worm, Melissa! I did not
think, I never think; but, oh, my girl, my lot
has many thorns! Alas, and alas!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">&#8216;Once I bloomed a maiden young</div>
<div class="verse">A widow&#8217;s woe now moves my tongue;&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>and a widow by desertion. Ah, how I hate
the taunt!&#8221; and she stamped her foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heed it not, dear Lady Betty,&#8221; murmured
Alice, &#8220;&#8217;tis not true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but it is, girl, it is,&#8221; cried Lady Clancarty,
with an impatient gesture, &#8220;and I despise
myself for caring.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure, madam, that Lord Clancarty
has made no effort to claim his bride, or to
see you?&#8221; Alice asked soberly, standing alone
in the triangle opposite Lady Betty, the sun
shining in a friendly fashion on her comely,
honest face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I sure?&#8221; repeated the countess in
surprise, and her expression changed swiftly;
&#8220;do you think he may have tried to communicate
with me and failed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not, my lady?&#8221; replied the handmaid
simply; &#8220;we know how my Lord Spencer
feels; and your father, the earl, madam, is,
perhaps, as little inclined toward your husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Betty sat looking down reflectively,
tapping her foot on the gravel path.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be so,&#8221; she said thoughtfully;
&#8220;your brain is growing keen, Alice, from crossing
swords with mine!&#8221; and she laughed, for
she was an April creature with swift-changing
moods. She rose, throwing out her hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
with a pretty gesture, as though she threw care
to the winds.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Donough Macarthy, Earl of Clancarty,
art worthy all these heart beats of mine?&#8221; she
cried, and laughed as gayly as a child. &#8220;I
tell thee, Alice, he has not seen me for years,
not since I was eleven, and he pictures me
with a turned-up nose and freckles and red
hair, and is half frightened to death at the
thought of his English bride.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your hair was never red, my lady,&#8221; said
Alice soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw, child, he has forgotten, poor lad!&#8221;
laughed Lady Betty, herself again; &#8220;he may
think my nose red, too!&#8221;</p>

<p class="ph3">LADY BETTY AND HER FATHER</p>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was after sundown and the light was
dim in the great gallery of Althorpe.
Candles were set in silver sconces at
intervals down its whole length of over a hundred
feet, but between lay soft shadows, and
the pictured faces of many famous men and
women, of sovereigns of England, statesmen,
soldiers, and court beauties, looked down from
the walls on either hand. Holbein and Van
Dyke and Lely had wrought upon these canvases.
Here was the famous Duchess of
Cleveland, painted by Lely, and the Countess
of Grammont, and yonder was Lady Portsmouth
and Nell Gwynne herself; and in this
strange company, the fair, sweet, coquettish
face of Betty Clancarty, lovely as any of the
court beauties and far more lovable and true.</p>

<p>The floor was polished and strewn with
splendid rugs; far-off India, Turkey, Italy,
France, and Holland had contributed rugs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
tapestries, paintings, beautiful bric-a-brac and
statuary to decorate the famous gallery of the
Spencers, where Anne of Denmark, Queen of
James the First, and the young Prince Charles,
the future royal martyr, saw the Masque of
Ben Jonson. Here, too, came doubtless King
Charles the First, he who created Henry
Spencer Earl of Sunderland; here, also,
reigned the daughter of the Sidneys, Dorothy,
Countess of Sunderland, the heroine of Waller&#8217;s
verses and the grandmother of Lady Betty.
A gallery full of memories, where royalty and
beauty smiled dimly from the great canvases,
and every footstep woke an echo of the past.</p>

<p>At that sunset hour the place was quiet save
for the cawing of the rooks under the eaves,
for they haunted every corner of the house and
congregated in the long avenues that enfiladed
the park; yet even the sound of bird consultations
did not disturb the revery of the man
who slowly paced up and down the gallery&mdash;a
man past middle age with an inscrutable face, his
head a little bowed as he walked, his hands behind
his back, his dress a long gown of black velvet,
ruffles of lace at the throat and over the slender
white hands&mdash;a strange man, self-possessed,
complacent, smooth, infinitely winning of address,
and one of the most unscrupulous politicians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and time-servers of that time-serving
age when William the Third knew not where
to look among his English counsellors for
steady faith, when it was no uncommon thing
for a man to swear allegiance both at Westminster
and Saint Germain, and to be an
apostate besides. Even in that age of falsehood
and double dealing, Robert, second Earl
of Sunderland, excelled his fellows; but if he
excelled them in falsehood, so did he also in
discernment, in the power to read men, and to
win them by his polished and smooth address,
the charm of a personality that had won even
upon the cold astuteness of the king himself.</p>

<p>Whatever his thoughts were now, Lord
Sunderland&#8217;s face was placid, his perfect mask
of serenity immutable, as he walked to and
fro, now and then pausing to look critically at
a fine picture, or to take counsel with himself,
and he looked up with a calm smile when the
door at the farther end of the gallery opened and
the graceful figure of Lady Betty came swiftly
toward him. He admired his daughter deeply,
but subtle as he was he did not understand
her. His standard of womanhood was different,
and he had no ennobling example in his
wife; she had been false to him and he had
known it, and had used the services of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
lover to smooth his own way with William of
Orange, while he himself was vowing fealty to
James the Second and walking barefoot, taper
in hand, to the chapel royal to be admitted
into the Roman communion&mdash;a communion
he renounced as easily at a convenient season.
This daughter who had grown up unlike either
parent in simplicity and retirement, this beautiful,
spirited, pure-souled creature he did not
understand, but he admired her, and after his
own fashion he loved her. On the other hand,
Lady Betty understood him in many ways
more thoroughly than he dreamed; she had a
woman&#8217;s intuitions, and she did not reverence
him; his subtlety, his falsehood, his smooth
affability did not deceive her; she looked at
him with clear eyes, and knew him better than
the wise and watchful sovereign whom he served.
But she was his daughter and she inherited all
his charm of manner, his smooth tongue, his
easy address, and he saw it and always smiled
upon her.</p>

<p>She came up to him now with a sparkle
in her eyes which portended more than he
imagined.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you better, sir?&#8221; she asked, with
solicitude; &#8220;your absence from table disturbed
me. Was it illness or politics?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>&#8220;Both, Betty,&#8221; replied the earl smiling;
&#8220;but you missed me not, you had a younger
and a better man in Spencer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith, sir, I would rather have a worse
one,&#8221; retorted Lady Betty, with a shrug, &#8220;such
piety and virtue are too much, they overwhelm
me. &#8217;Tis a pity that good men are so often
bores!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sunderland smiled, amusement twinkling in
his deep-set eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have often found them so, Betty,&#8221; he
admitted; &#8220;but Charles is a worthy youth, my
dear, and his advice, though often somewhat
tedious and long winded, is weighty and
merits consideration.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be so,&#8221; replied the countess, with
an arch smile; &#8220;but upon my soul, sir, he was
so long and loud in braying it at me that I
fell to looking at his ears, expecting to see
them start up on either side of his head and
grow long and pointed. He is tedious!&#8221; and
her ladyship yawned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brothers often are, Betty,&#8221; remarked the
earl smiling; &#8220;you must have other and gayer
company. In fact, I was but now planning to
send you to Newmarket for the races; Lady
Sunderland is there, Spencer is going, and I go
presently. You have lived too much in retirement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
here; you must go to Newmarket and
hear gayer talk than the discourses of our
young sage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to escape the oracle,&#8221; said
the countess; but she glanced searchingly at
her father and added quietly, &#8220;My retirement
becomes me, sir; I am practically a
widow.&#8221;</p>

<p>The earl&#8217;s expression changed a trifle, but
such a trifle that his daughter made little of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will not refer to that unhappy contract,&#8221;
he said smoothly; &#8220;it was an error on
my part, Elizabeth, and I assure you I repent
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has Lord Clancarty written to you, father?&#8221;
she asked, so abruptly that Sunderland started,
and for an instant his eye faltered under hers,
and he hesitated before he was himself again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; he said calmly, closing his silver
snuff-box and giving the lid a friendly little
tap.</p>

<p>His momentary confusion, though, was
nearly his undoing; his daughter laid a white
hand on his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has written you,&#8221; she said imperiously,
&#8220;and lately, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon my word, Elizabeth,&#8221; said the earl
frowning, &#8220;you go too far.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>&#8220;I cannot help it,&#8221; she cried impetuously.
&#8220;Have I no rights? Ought it to be concealed
from me and confided to my brother,
who only taunts me? My husband has written
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sunderland had recovered himself now,
however, and smiled calmly at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are too headstrong, my love,&#8221; he
said smoothly, &#8220;too easily suspicious. If
Clancarty wrote, why should I conceal it?
As you remark, he is your husband in the
eyes of the law, but your husband in fact he
is not, and trust me, Betty, he is too great a
Jacobite to risk himself in England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, father, the Peace of Ryswick has
brought many back,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and we all
know&mdash;it is notorious how easy King William
is&mdash;and you, you could get Clancarty&#8217;s
pardon a thousand times over, if you would!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear the child!&#8221; said Sunderland, with a
gesture of mock despair. &#8220;Why, Betty,
&#8217;twas marvellous hard to get my own, and the
politicians hate me so that not even Spencer&#8217;s
devotion to the Whigs appeases that party.
Clancarty&#8217;s pardon!&mdash;&#8217;twould cost me my
liberty and, perhaps, my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; pouted Lady Betty; &#8220;you
are the king&#8217;s friend; I will not believe you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
And you might, at least, take thought of me;
I am his wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O child, child!&#8221; laughed Lord Sunderland,
&#8220;as little his wife as my Lady Devonshire
or the Princess Anne. Married to him,
through your father&#8217;s folly, when you were
eleven and parted from him on the instant.
What virtue is there in such a contract? Be
sure, my love, he has in no wise respected it&mdash;nor
will he while I have my daughter safe
with me. Think not of him, Betty! &#8217;Twas
my folly, but then he possessed large estates in
Munster and it promised to be a great match;
for, believe me, I had no thought of tying
you to a proscribed and penniless scapegrace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said Lady Betty, with spirit, &#8220;he
was rich and now he is poor; therefore, my
lord, I will not desert him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Sunderland laughed, but his eyes did
not laugh with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no question of desertion, my
child,&#8221; he said smoothly, &#8220;you are not his
wife, and you never shall be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, sir,&#8221; retorted the incorrigible
countess, &#8220;I am his wife, and I will
be no other man&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tush!&#8221; replied the earl impatiently, &#8220;you
know not what you say. Go to your apartment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Elizabeth, and reflect upon the matter
until you recollect your duty to me. Here
comes Spencer now with some visitors, and I
have no more leisure for your childish folly.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Lady Betty would not be silenced; as
she retired toward the door opposite the one
that was opening to admit the earl&#8217;s visitors,
she murmured low but distinctly,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am his wife, my lord, and I will be no
less,&#8221; and she swept out with her face aflame
and her head high.</p>

<p>She came to the head of the great staircase
and stood looking down, gracefully poised, her
finger on her lips; a charming figure, musing
upon destiny, with the soft candle-light shining
down upon her stately young head and her
flowing white robes. She began to hum softly
to herself the air of &#8220;Roseen Dhu.&#8221;</p>

<p class="ph3">IN THE WOODS OF ALTHORPE</p>


<p class="drop-cap2">ALTHORPE, called in Domesday Books
&#8220;Ollethorp,&#8221;&mdash;and held before the
Conquest, as the freehold of Tosti
and Snorterman,&mdash;had been the home of the
Spencers since the days of Henry the Seventh,
when one John Catesby, second son of John
Catesby of Legus Ashby, sold it to John
Spencer, Esquire, son of William Spencer of
Wormleighton, in Warwickshire, descended
from the younger branch of the Despencers,
anciently Earls of Gloucester and Winchester,
and still more remotely from Ivo, Viscount
Constantine, who married Emma, daughter
of Alan of Brittany, before the Conquest&mdash;coming,
therefore, by blood from one of the
great feudal lords of France.</p>

<p>Althorpe House was built of freestone, in
the form of the letter H, the two long wings
joined by a central building in which was the
main entrance facing south. It stood in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
beautiful spot, level and well wooded. The
old gatehouse, remnant of the feudal strength
of Althorpe, had once been surrounded by a
moat, but that had long since run dry and was
overgrown with turf as smooth as velvet. The
long avenues of elms and beeches and limes
ran from it to the very doors of the earl&#8217;s
house, and about it lay the park, enfiladed by
those avenues of stately trees, while beyond
were the meadows&mdash;in the old time it was said
that there were eight acres of meadowland and
two of thornwood in one small portion of the
freehold of Ollethorp&mdash;and now the great
domain stretched out on every hand, beautified
by nature and by art.</p>

<p>It was in the woods of the park that Lady
Betty and her attendant, Alice Lynn, walked
on the morning after her interview with her
father. It was too threatening to set out
upon the journey to Newmarket, so they
strolled on the outskirts of the earl&#8217;s domain.
Both girls were cloaked and hooded and prepared
for rain and, indeed, more than once
there was the sharp pattering of drops on the
thick foliage overhead. They did not hasten
their steps, for neither of them feared the
elements, and Lady Betty really feared nothing
greatly, being a high-spirited and daring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
young creature who loved adventure well. A
fresh breeze began to blow, rustling the leaves,
and the branches swayed and creaked above
them, a trellis-work of wavering green through
which the gray sky blinked occasionally. To
the left was a coppice, black with shadows;
before them, here and there, a wide vista of
open fields showed the grass rippling in a
thousand waves; and again the tree-tops that
seemed to touch the long, ragged clouds
scudding so low, heavy with moisture and
torn by wind. And the same wind&mdash;grown
caressing&mdash;tossed the soft locks of Lady
Betty&#8217;s hair into little curls about her face
under the yellow bird&#8217;s-eye hood.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you there, Alice?&#8221; she asked,
as the girl stooped and peeped into a patch of
grass growing in an opening between the trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis but a four-leafed clover, madam,&#8221;
Alice replied, pulling it.</p>

<p>Lady Clancarty took it and looked at it
with a quizzical eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a saying in Devonshire,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;that if you find a four-leafed clover and
an even-leafed ash on the same day you will
surely see your love ere sundown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have none, my lady,&#8221; replied Alice
demurely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>Lady Betty laughed with a delicious ripple
of merriment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have none, girl?&#8221; she said archly.
&#8220;What a prompt confession! I grow suspicious,
Alice, and see, there is the tell-tale
blood creeping up to your hair. Fie, girl, fie!
Where is thy true love, thine own love
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, I know not, madam,&#8221; replied
Alice meekly; &#8220;no one ever wooed me but
the parson, and his mouth was so large that it
frightened me; it did open his head like a
lid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy on us, girl, &#8217;twas an opening in life
for you,&#8221; laughed Lady Betty; &#8220;and &#8217;tis said
that a large mouth is generous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was a great eater, madam,&#8221; replied the
handmaid bluntly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then were you surely meant for him,
lass, for you are a famous maker of pastries,
as I know. But tell me, Alice, did ever you
have your fortune told?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, &#8217;twas not thought seemly by my
aunt,&#8221; replied Alice; &#8220;I was reared as strict as
any Calvinist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet live with a sinner,&#8221; said Lady
Clancarty with a smile. &#8220;I would inquire my
fate, if there be any fortune-teller or sooth-sayer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
near. I grow more curious every day,
Alice, to know what the end may be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ignorance is ofttimes best, my lady,&#8221;
quietly replied her attendant.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be,&#8221; Lady Clancarty said; &#8220;but
sooth, Alice, &#8217;tis very trying. I would fain
know&mdash;I would fathom that dark cloud that
hangs upon my destiny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Lady Betty,&#8221; Alice said, &#8220;is there
indeed a dark cloud upon it? It seems to my
humble vision fair as summer sunshine, and
high and noble.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mistress sighed. &#8220;Ah, simple maid,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;look not enviously upon high
estate. Light hearted I was born, gay and
full of recklessness, I believe, but happy&mdash;ah,
Alice, once I was! But now, my mind
keeps turning ever to the thought of one less
happy; I have a home and he&mdash;he has none;
I have friends&mdash;belike, he is friendless. I
have money, a dower cut from his estates
in Munster; he is a beggar! O Alice, it
grieves me; I would fain help him; I would
fain give him back my dower; I would&mdash;oh,
do you not see what I must seem to
him? Heartless, cold, without sense of my
duty, a robber and an enemy? I who am
true, I who have only too kind a heart, I who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
would give my all to help him&mdash;what is the
song?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8216;Oh, I could kneel all night in prayer,</div>
<div class="verse">To heal your many ills!&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Alice, I must know how my husband fares,
I&mdash;mercy on us, girl, what ails you?&#8221;
she cried, for Alice had given a scream of
alarm, starting back from the coppice near at
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some one there!&#8221; cried the
handmaid, in agitation, &#8220;I saw a man&#8217;s boot
and spur yonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; demanded Lady Betty impatiently,
&#8220;where is your scare-crow, you little
simpleton?&#8221;</p>

<p>But before Alice could reply a large man
emerged from the beeches and advanced
toward them. He was clad in a long riding
coat of dark blue with deep capes, and his
high boots were splashed with mud. As he
approached he lifted his wide-brimmed, beplumed
hat, uncovering a head which was
striking in contour. His face was of a bold
and handsome type and his dark gray eyes
were keen; he wore the full, long periwig of
the prevailing fashion and a flowing cravat of
Flemish lace.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>&#8220;A likely bugbear, my girl,&#8221; whispered
Lady Betty roguishly, pinching Alice&#8217;s arm,
but turning an innocent face upon the
stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I crave pardon,&#8221; he said, with an easy
salutation, &#8220;I have lost my way; will you
direct me to Northampton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The town lies five miles from us, sir,&#8221;
replied Lady Betty, &#8220;and the tavern of the
King&#8217;s Arms is upon the high street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you,&#8221; he replied courteously, but
with no apparent desire to depart, and gazed
at Lady Clancarty with an open admiration
that offended Alice, who plucked at her
mistress&#8217; sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you tell me what place this is?&#8221; he
added, pointing at Althorpe House.</p>

<p>&#8220;It belongs to our master, the Earl of
Sunderland,&#8221; replied Lady Betty, affecting
the pert air of a waiting-maid; &#8220;&#8217;tis a fine
place, sir, with a gallery full of pictures and
another full of books and books and books!
Dear me, sir, a sight of &#8217;em! Your worship
should go and look at &#8217;em; &#8217;tis a very hospitable
house, too, and strangers are made
welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; he said, with a smile, &#8220;I would
be glad to avail myself of the opportunity&mdash;at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
another season. And you, my pretty
maids, are the keeper&#8217;s daughters?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith, yes, sir,&#8221; said Lady Clancarty, dropping
a courtesy, &#8220;we&#8217;re twins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Saint Patrick, you are strangely untwinlike!&#8221;
remarked the stranger frankly; &#8220;never
saw I two birds from one nest with less resemblance;
one a pigeon and the other&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, your honor?&#8221; demanded Lady
Betty roguishly, while Alice plucked at her
skirts in genuine confusion and fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bird of Paradise,&#8221; said he gallantly, kissing
the tips of his fingers to her.</p>

<p>Lady Betty hung her head, simpering like
the veriest country girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith, sir,&#8221; she said, fingering her kerchief,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what that is. Is it
poultry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has wings, my dear,&#8221; he replied smiling,
&#8220;but, in this case, they are only figurative.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;La, sir!&#8221; cried Lady Betty, &#8220;what&#8217;s
that? It sounds like something strange.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a figure of speech, my girl,&#8221; he replied,
a daring smile in his gray eyes as he
drew a step nearer and Betty retreated a step,
partly drawn by Alice; &#8220;but eyes like stars
and cheeks like roses do not belong to the
barnyard.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>Her ladyship, suspecting that she had betrayed
herself, bridled a little, but her love of
mischief kept her from flight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith!&#8221; she said, looking down, &#8220;you
fine gentlemen talk so finely that a poor maid
cannot follow you. Go to the tavern, sir, and
there your worship will find a listener after
your own heart, for they do say that saucy
Polly can talk up to Lord Spencer himself, and
he&#8217;s the most learned man in England, sir;
and, indeed, I do believe that all the others
that ever knew half as much died of it immediately
and were buried! Go to the tavern, sir,
and good cheer to you and good by,&#8221; and her
ladyship dropped another awkward courtesy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, lass, a kiss and a crown for your
pains,&#8221; said the stranger, making a sudden
attempt to catch her by the arm.</p>

<p>But Lady Betty danced off as light as a
feather, laughing roguishly under her hood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, sir,&#8221; she said wickedly, &#8220;girls do
not kiss strangers in this country if they do&mdash;in
France!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound the witch!&#8221; ejaculated the
traveller, with a start of surprise. &#8220;Pshaw!
&#8217;twas my French coin she saw,&#8221; he added, and
smiled as he watched the two girlish figures
flying through the trees.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>Meanwhile Lady Betty was laughing and
Alice remonstrating.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my lady, how could you?&#8221; she said;
&#8220;he might recognize you, he might have kissed
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So he might!&#8221; admitted Lady Clancarty
gleefully, &#8220;and how handsome he is! Did you
mark him, Alice, is he not handsome?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, madam,&#8221; said the discreet handmaid,
still shocked and frightened, &#8220;that I know
not, but he was overbold in staring at your
ladyship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he so?&#8221; asked Lady Betty pensively,
blushing in a tell-tale fashion; &#8220;I noted
it not; but was he not tall and strong
and finely framed, Alice, with a bonny gray
eye?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, comely enough in appearance, my
lady, but bold and with a reckless air; I trembled
lest he should insult you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh, pooh, girl, you would love a milksop!&#8221;
said Lady Betty petulantly; &#8220;he has
the very eye and front of a soldier. I&#8217;ll wager
he is some gallant who can strike a good blow
for his sweetheart. What fun would there be
in life without a harmless jest? He took me
for a waiting-woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That he did not!&#8221; cried Alice, &#8220;he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
you, take my word for it, and he would have
kissed you, the daring wretch!&#8221;</p>

<p>The handmaid shuddered at the thought
and the mistress laughed at her perturbation,
laughed with sweet gayety, her mirth rippling
in low, joyous notes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no eye for a fine man, Alice,&#8221;
she said blithely; &#8220;you little prude, do you
think I would have let him? Nay, then do
you not know me; but &#8217;twas rare fun to see
the dare-devil in those gray eyes of his. He
has French gold, too, and mercy, how startled
he was at my haphazard shot. &#8217;Tis some
Jacobite, and there are fierce Whigs at Northampton!
Lackaday, the poor gentleman may
come into trouble, I must warn him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My lady, my lady,&#8221; protested Alice, and
then stood aghast. &#8220;The saints help us,&#8221; she
murmured, &#8220;there she runs after that bold
gallant, like a village lass, and if the earl should
see her!&#8221;</p>

<p>But generous-hearted Lady Clancarty thought
of neither Alice nor the earl. Light of foot as
any fawn, she flew over the green after the
stranger&#8217;s retreating figure, for he had turned
in another direction and was leading a black
horse by the bridle. The swift run and the
excitement of the moment brought the blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
to Betty&#8217;s cheeks, and she panted for breath
when she overtook him.</p>

<p>He turned with a smile. &#8220;What, lass,&#8221; he
said gayly, &#8220;hast come for your kiss?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Clancarty gasped and grew crimson
with shame; then drawing herself up to her
full height, she flashed at him a look of withering
scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mistake, sir,&#8221; she said haughtily, &#8220;you
are addressing Lady Clancarty.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took off his hat and the long plumes
swept the ground at her feet as he made her a
profound obeisance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beseech your ladyship&#8217;s pardon,&#8221; he said,
graceful and gracious&mdash;but not one whit
abashed, &#8220;my eyes were dazzled&mdash;else they
would have made no such mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Betty would not be appeased; like a
child who has been naughty and repented, she
tried to appear as if it had not been. She was
cold and haughty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, I would merely warn you to be less
careless of your French gold at Northampton,&#8221;
she said; &#8220;we do not love St. Germain here,&#8221;
and with a courtesy as low as his bow she
left him.</p>

<p>Left him staring after her with a glow in his
gray eyes.</p>



<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>Alice Lynn usually slept in a little anteroom
of Lady Betty&#8217;s bedchamber, and that night
as she lay abed she was awakened suddenly.
The room was full of moonlight, and in it
stood Lady Betty in her night-rail,&mdash;a charming
figure, with softly dishevelled hair about
her shoulders, and eyes that seemed to sparkle
in the pale duskiness of her face. The tirewoman
started up in alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lady, oh, my lady!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;are
you ill? Has aught happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, no, no!&#8221; whispered Lady Betty,
with a soft little laugh; &#8220;but, Alice, didn&#8217;t
you notice that he said &#8216;by Saint Patrick&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He! Who?&#8221; groaned poor Alice sleepily.</p>

<p>&#8220;The stranger, little goose!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, madam,&#8221; said the poor handmaid;
&#8220;I noticed naught but his bold eyes; I was
afraid of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; Lady Betty exclaimed with
a gesture of impatience; and she tripped lightly
to the window and stood looking out over the
moonlit park.</p>

<p>Alice yawned, drawing herself together on
the edge of her bed in a crumpled attitude, one
pink foot swinging near the floor; she was
fairly nodding with sleep. Not so her mistress.
Lady Betty brushed the soft hair from her face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and stood in the moonlight a lovely figure,
half revealed and half concealed by thin white
draperies.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; she said musingly, &#8220;if&mdash;if
Clancarty looks at all like this man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot tell, madam,&#8221; replied Alice demurely;
&#8220;but it may be so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You rogue!&#8221; laughed her mistress, &#8220;you
would insinuate that two rakes may well resemble
each other! Ah, Alice, he is my husband,
mind you that, and a woman&#8217;s husband
is not as other men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know him not at all, my lady,&#8221; yawned
Alice, rubbing her eyes, &#8220;and if he&#8217;s like
some&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fudge, my girl, what do you know of husbands?&#8221;
said Betty gayly; &#8220;I believe you have
never even glanced out of the tail of that blue
eye of yours at any bold gallant yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The handmaid sighed sleepily.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis better so, my lady,&#8221; she said meekly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The parson not excepted!&#8221; laughed Lady
Betty, dancing back lightly over the floor and
pinching the girl&#8217;s cheek as she passed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>sang my lady, taking dancing steps as she
tripped toward her own door; she was full of
gayety, incorrigible and delightful as ever,
though the great clock on the stairs was striking
twelve. But Alice sighed drearily, and her
mistress heard her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor lass!&#8221; she laughed, &#8220;go to sleep; I
am a heartless wretch,&#8221; and she ran off laughing
to her room, and Alice sank on her pillows
again with a sigh of despair.</p>

<p class="ph3">LADY SUNDERLAND</p>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was at night too, a week later, that Lady
Betty&#8217;s coach rumbled up the long street
at Newmarket. But no moon shone;
instead, the rain came down in torrents and
the wind dashed it against the glass windows
and rattled and shook the heavy doors, while
the horses slipped and floundered, knee deep
in mud; the great coach itself lurched heavily
out of one huge rut into another, and the postilions,
dripping and profane, cracked their
whips and shouted. Lady Clancarty and her
attendants, Alice Lynn and the woman, Melissa
Thurle, bounced about within the vehicle,
coming now and then into collision with endless
boxes and bundles, a part only of the
countess&#8217; impedimenta, the most perishable,
and therefore gathered within the carriage to
save it from the deluge, instead of being
strapped on top with the heavier luggage.</p>

<p>Through the moist darkness lights began to
twinkle. As they neared the inn these lanterns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
increased in numbers, their yellow radiance
dimmed and blurred by the rain but
showing in a broad circle of warmth before the
tavern door. There, too, the water flooding
the kennels had poured out, making a small
lake in the courtyard. The coach went
splashing into it and halted with muddy water
rising to the hubs. The inn door was open, and
the hall overflowed with noise and good cheer;
lackeys and grooms came bustling at the sound
of an arrival; and at the sight of a private carriage,
with an earl&#8217;s crest emblazoned upon the
door, mine host himself came hurrying forward
but stood aghast at the puddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, you varlets,&#8221; he shouted, clapping
his hands, &#8220;a plank from the door to the carriage
steps, or her ladyship cannot descend.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her ladyship&#8217;s roguish face was at the window
as he spoke and she watched the men
placing a board for her. As they opened the
coach door the innkeeper bowed low, his
broad back in the air, but stepping carefully
on the plank and tottering uneasily, for he
was a stout man and in terror of falling headlong
into the flood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who have I the honor to serve, my lady?&#8221;
he inquired, all smiles in spite of his perilous
position.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>&#8220;Venus rising from the waves, sir,&#8221; replied
Lady Betty flippantly, as she sprang lightly
across the improvised bridge, scarcely touching
his shoulder with her fingers and quite regardless
of his open-mouthed astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look to it that my women are not
drowned!&#8221; she added imperiously, as he retreated
after her, leaving her attendants to
climb out unassisted.</p>

<p>But the man was sorely perplexed by her
ladyship&#8217;s announcement of herself, and he
only stared at her, trying to place her in the
gallery of a fertile brain well stored with great
ladies; but this face&mdash;albeit one of the most
charming he had ever seen&mdash;was not among
them, and he stared, perhaps a trifle rudely,
for Lady Betty&#8217;s eye, suddenly alighting on
him, her chin went up.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will show me to my Lady Sunderland&#8217;s
apartments,&#8221; she said in an icy tone, as
she waved her hand toward the stair.</p>

<p>In a moment the innkeeper&#8217;s supple back
bent double again; he threw out his fat hands
and stammered a hundred apologies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Sunderland did not look for your
ladyship until to-morrow,&#8221; he sputtered, hurrying
on ahead, while Lady Clancarty followed,
with her chin still scornfully elevated, her two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
weary and dishevelled women behind her.
&#8220;The countess will be rejoiced&mdash;we are all
rejoiced, your ladyship; the storm was so
heavy, the roads so fearful, we scarcely dared
to hope that your carriage would reach Newmarket
to-night,&#8221; continued the host, all smiles
again, rubbing his hands and flourishing before
her ladyship.</p>

<p>But Lady Betty walked on in silence, scarce
glancing at him as he opened a door and, with
many flourishes and bows, announced her at
the threshold and stood aside, still bowing, to
let her pass into a large, well-lighted room,
where a bright fire burned upon the hearth,
great logs ablaze upon the high, polished brass
andirons. The dark wood floor was polished
too, reflecting the blaze, and in a great chair
by the fire sat a woman past middle age, yet
showing little of her years, and dressed in the
extreme affectation of a youthful fashion, a
petticoat of white brocade, which was short in
front to show her feet in white and gold pantoffles,
and a bodice and overdress of peachblow
satin; a face that had been handsome and was
now much rouged, the eyes brightened by
dark rings beneath them, while her hair&mdash;or
her periwig&mdash;was frizzed full at the sides
after a fashion much in vogue in the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Charles the Second. Her throat was covered
with jewels, and her hands and arms; on either
side of her stood two young men of fashion,
beaux of Newmarket, in gay velvet coats and
ruffles of lace, and long curled and scented
French periwigs, white satin breeches and silk
stockings, and slippers with high red heels,
then much in favor at Versailles.</p>

<p>It was a group that amused Lady Clancarty,&mdash;the
great lady and her two youthful admirers,
for Betty knew her mother well. They in
their turn stared a little at the traveller&#8217;s unexpected
advent, and for a moment no one spoke.
There was a strange contrast between the
painted and bejewelled countess and her daughter:
Lady Clancarty wore a long, dark riding-coat
with capes, her full skirts trailing below the
coat, and her hat&mdash;a large one with plumes&mdash;set
over her brows. The cool damp night air
had brought the freshness of a rose to her cheeks
and her eyes sparkled as she viewed the party
by the fire, and made her mother a courtesy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been in the deluge, madam,&#8221; she
said gayly. &#8220;Faith! I had expected to be
drowned, but lo! our ark landed here, and
here am I&mdash;a dove with an olive branch, in
fact&mdash;for I come with kind messages from
Althorpe for your ladyship.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>&#8220;My dear Betty,&#8221; said Lady Sunderland,
recovering from her amazement, &#8220;I am delighted;
come and kiss me, my love, and here&mdash;my
Lord Savile and Mr. Benham, this is
my daughter, Lady Elizabeth Spencer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young men bowed profoundly, Lord
Savile&#8217;s bold eyes on Lady Betty&#8217;s face, for he
saw it flush with sudden indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother&#8217;s memory plays her false,&#8221;
she said coldly, scarcely acknowledging their
greetings; &#8220;I am the Countess of Clancarty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Sunderland laughed angrily but pretended
to be merry.</p>

<p>&#8220;The child is foolish about a trifle,&#8221; she
said, winking behind her fan at young Savile.
&#8220;We can afford to humor her whims, my lord;
we will call her Lady Clancarty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall call her ladyship divine, if she
wills it,&#8221; replied Lord Savile, with a smile at
Betty; &#8220;it is all one to us as long as she is
pleased.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Clancarty&#8217;s foot tapped the floor impatiently
and there was a dangerous sparkle
in her eyes. Lady Sunderland observed her
uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;My love, you are tired,&#8221; she said, mildly
solicitous, &#8220;sit down and let me send for a cup
of tea; Mr. Benham&mdash;ah, my lord, thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
you, yes, the bell&mdash;a dish of tea for Lady
Spen&mdash;Lady Clancarty. There&mdash;there, my
dear, don&#8217;t frown at me; it is all quite ridiculous!
Mr. Benham will arrange the cushions
in that chair for you; I don&#8217;t know what I
should do without him! We were playing
gleek, Betty, when you were announced.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty was now ensconced in an armchair by
the fire, her little feet on the cushion that Mr.
Benham had placed for her; and she viewed the
situation with an expression more composed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I take tea,&#8221; she said to Lord Savile,
who was handing her a smoking cup, &#8220;and
what is this?&#8221; she added, for he had managed
to drop a flower from his buttonhole into her
lap with an air of gallantry.</p>

<p>&#8220;A poor blossom,&#8221; he said gracefully, &#8220;to
compare with such a rose as blooms here
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Betty looked at him and then at the
flower curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; she said calmly sipping her tea, &#8220;it
<i>is</i> a rose&mdash;I thought &#8217;twas a thistle!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Sunderland coughed and dropped her
fan and frowned at her daughter; but the
incorrigible countess did not glance in her
direction. She was smiling blandly at the fire
and warming first one foot and then the other.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>&#8220;You are from Althorpe?&#8221; Mr. Benham
asked, smiling at the beauty, for he was not
displeased at Lord Savile&#8217;s discomfiture; &#8220;and
my friend, Spencer, is there now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is indeed,&#8221; replied Betty, with a sigh,
&#8220;and may he stay there!&#8221; she added mentally;
but to Mr. Benham, &#8220;Has the king
come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He came yesterday, and with him, Lord
Albemarle; the Princess Anne is here too,
and my Lady Marlborough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me,&#8221; said Lady Betty, with an unconcealed
yawn, &#8220;the world is here, it seems,
and I am so weary that I must crave your
ladyship&#8217;s license to retire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; said Mr. Benham gallantly, &#8220;it is
my lord and I who should retire and permit
your ladyship to rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I protest!&#8221; cried Lady Sunderland; &#8220;the
gleek was but half played.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she made no great effort to detain them;
indeed, she wanted an opportunity to speak
plainly to her daughter, so the beaux were
allowed to bow themselves out, with more than
one lingering glance at the beautiful, haughty
face by the fireside. No sooner was the door
closed, however, than Lady Sunderland turned
on her daughter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>&#8220;Your folly passes belief, Elizabeth,&#8221; she
said tartly, quite oblivious of the two attendants
quietly waiting in the background; &#8220;I am
tired of the name of Clancarty; your father
and I intend to divorce the rascal. To parade
the matter as you do is simply childish, my
love, quite childish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Betty sipped her tea and looked into
the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not divorced,&#8221; she remarked placidly,
&#8220;and Lord Clancarty, being a Romanist, may
object to divorces.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Sunderland laughed unpleasantly, tapping
her fan on the arm of her chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Clancarty has probably never respected
his marriage,&#8221; she remarked, in a
biting tone, though she smiled; &#8220;you are very
childish, Elizabeth, for your years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>am</i> quite advanced,&#8221; her daughter replied,
rising and setting her cup on the table
where the cards were scattered, &#8220;and perhaps
I am too old to think of divorces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; Lady Sunderland said frowning,
&#8220;your father and I mean to see you well
married when we are rid of this Irish nuisance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; said Lady Betty coldly, elevating
her brows, &#8220;to whom? My Lord Savile, for
instance, or Mr. Benham?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>&#8220;You might do worse,&#8221; retorted Lady Sunderland
stiffly; &#8220;they are both fine young men
and in favor at court.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely,&#8221; said Lady Betty, &#8220;and &#8217;tis
strange that my taste is so perverted. Dear
madam, I bid you good-night. We will discuss
their excellencies later; now I am perishing
with sleep,&#8221; and she dropped her mother
a courtesy and slipped out of the room, leaving
the older countess frowning and biting her
lips, the rouge showing red on her cheeks.</p>

<p>But once alone with Alice Lynn, Betty
laughed, with tears shining in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, the trap is set, Alice, dear,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;the trap is set, if only this poor little mouse
will nibble at the cheese!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">LADY BETTY&#8217;S TOILET</p>


<p class="drop-cap">NIGHT and the rain departed together.
The wind had swept the sky clear,
not even a white feather curled there;
it was blue&mdash;blue as English skies seldom are.
Lady Betty, opening her own window shutter,
looked up and smiled, and then looked down
into the courtyard of the inn. The waters
were subsiding, and the uneven flagging showed
muddy, wet and glistening in the sunlight.
To the left lay the stables, where she could
occasionally hear a horse neigh or stamp an
impatient foot. To the right the court was
railed off by an old balustrade of gray stone,
mossy and green with age and opening in the
centre with two vases on either side filled with
geraniums and mignonette. Between these,
steps descended into an old garden, laid out in
quaint flower-beds, surrounded with rows of
box that hedged in the winding gravel paths
and grew high as a man&#8217;s head. It was September,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
but many flowers bloomed there besides
the roses; though it was but poorly
tended at this late season, it was still a spot of
beauty for the guests of the tavern to look
upon, and there was a restful air about it, a
fragrance and quaintness, with the early sunshine
on it. It was so early, indeed, that the
garden was deserted, and only the stable-boys
were stirring and the servants running to and
fro across the court engaged in preparations for
breakfast. Here and there was a red-coated
hostler, and one of these was leading a black
horse up and down. The horse had just been
unsaddled and was heated from hard riding.
There was mud on his flanks, too, which was
natural enough after the storm, and there were
flecks of foam upon his breast. Lady Betty
looked at him long and pensively, noting that
the bridle was not of English make; the man,
too, who had him, was a stranger, for the other
hostlers did not speak to him, and his broad,
humorous face and twinkling black eyes were
quite un-English. He was a short man, with
bowed legs and a bulky frame, plainly dressed
as the plainest groom of a gentleman could be,
and yet these two, the horse and man, held
Lady Betty&#8217;s attention long&mdash;so long, indeed,
that she did not notice the soft opening of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
door, or the soft tread on the floor behind her,
and started to find Melissa Thurle at her
elbow.</p>

<p>The woman had a smooth face and pale eyes
that squinted like those of a near-sighted person,
though she was not short-sighted. She
moved, too, as softly as a cat, and her manners
were always apologetic, humbly ingratiating;
she cringed a little now under Lady Betty&#8217;s
eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Alice?&#8221; Lady Clancarty demanded
sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her ladyship, your mother, sent for her,&#8221;
Melissa said gently; &#8220;her tirewoman is ill to-day,
and Lady Sunderland sent to your rooms
for one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did Alice go?&#8221; asked Lady Betty
imperiously. &#8220;You know you cannot do my
hair; besides, you would suit my mother exactly.
Why did you stay here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Melissa looked down meekly. &#8220;My lady,
the countess sent for Alice Lynn,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>Lady Betty&#8217;s brows went up. &#8220;Strange,&#8221;
she remarked; &#8220;we all know that she will not
be up until eleven,&mdash;why Alice now? I cannot
do without Alice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do my best, my lady,&#8221; Melissa said,
with a deprecating purr; &#8220;if you will but choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
your costume for the races I can surely arrange
everything for you quite as well as Alice, and
indeed your ladyship needs no very skilful
tirewoman; where there is so much beauty
there is no need for much skill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty eyed the woman with a distinct feeling
of repugnance and yet thought herself unjust.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go fetch me a dish of tea,&#8221; she said languidly,
&#8220;and I will think about to-day. Dear
me, what a bore it is to wear clothes; if only
one had feathers!&#8221;</p>

<p>Melissa stared but went to fetch the tea, a
luxury much affected by the rich, for tea-drinking
came into fashion at the East India houses
in the time of Charles the Second.</p>

<p>Lady Betty did not wish the tea; however,
she wanted to be rid of Melissa, and she went
back to the window and looked out eagerly.
The black horse and groom were both gone,
and she turned away disappointed.</p>

<p>Two hours later, Alice being still with Lady
Sunderland, Melissa Thurle dressed Lady
Clancarty for the gala day at the Newmarket
races. And a wonderful work it was to dress
a belle in those days of brocaded farthingales
and long, narrow-waisted bodices, and heads
covered with many waves and puffs and ringlets.
It was not then the fashion to powder the hair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
and Lady Betty&#8217;s beautiful glossy black tresses
curled naturally, so that Melissa&#8217;s task was not
the most difficult. The mass of soft, wavy hair
was knotted low on the back of the head and
escaped in curls about the brow and cheeks and
fell upon the neck, while one or two black
patches on brow and cheek were supposed to
enhance the whiteness of the complexion.
Melissa was skilful enough, in spite of her
mistress&#8217; prejudices, and her deft fingers arranged
the curls, letting some escape in coquettish
waves and ringlets and binding others
back into the loose knot, which still allowed
them to ripple in a lovely confusion.</p>

<p>Lady Betty sat, meanwhile, before a dressing-table,
furnished with a small oval glass in
which she could not only watch Melissa, but
could observe, also, every curve and dimple of
her own charming face. Whether its reflection
really satisfied her, or she had other and
more fruitful sources of content, can only be
conjectured, but certain it is that she smiled
a little and bore the tirewoman&#8217;s deft touches
with apparent complacence. Melissa, encouraged
by her expression, began to talk to her
in a soft purring fashion as she worked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The house is full, my lady,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;&#8217;tis all agog below stairs now, and &#8217;tis said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
there are two dukes, an earl, and five baronets
under this roof, besides the countess and your
ladyship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me,&#8221; said Lady Betty, &#8220;who are
all these great people, and when did they
come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke of Bedford has been here two
days, my lady,&#8221; replied the newscarrier, &#8220;and
the Duke of Ormond came yesterday; Mr.
Godolphin, too, and Lord Wharton,&mdash;the
others?&mdash;I know not when they came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who came this morning?&#8221; asked her
mistress carelessly, at the same moment turning
her head to admire a new knot that Melissa
had made of her hair.</p>

<p>The tirewoman stopped, comb in hand, and
admired too, her narrow eyes more narrow
than usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;This morning?&#8221; she repeated thoughtfully,
&#8220;I cannot think,&mdash;oh, yes, one of the housemaids
told me that a stranger came late, on a
black horse that he had ridden hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Clancarty listened attentively, forgetting
to appear indifferent, and unconscious of
the peculiar vigilance of Melissa&#8217;s pale eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The horse was in the yard this morning
and showed hard riding,&#8221; she said thoughtfully.
&#8220;Who was the stranger, Melissa?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>&#8220;&#8217;Tis said he is a horse jockey from London,&#8221;
purred the tirewoman.</p>

<p>Her mistress darted a searching look at her
but read nothing in that smooth face that was
by nature as placid as a platter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring me my pale blue paduasoy petticoat,
Thurle,&#8221; Lady Betty said, sharply imperious,
&#8220;and my white and silver brocaded
gown, and the mantle of silver lace, and my
hat with the white plumes. Do you not know
how to fasten a petticoat?&mdash;there&mdash;so!&mdash;and,
stupid, my white silk stockings with the
blue clocks, and the French slippers with blue
enamel buckles,&#8221; and she made the woman
fetch garment after garment with alacrity, and
the glow in her cheeks would have warned
even a less observant person than Melissa that
Lady Clancarty was out of temper.</p>

<p>But the woman&#8217;s smooth manner remained
unruffled, and not even angry words made her
fingers quiver. She arrayed Lady Clancarty
from head to foot, deftly and swiftly, and when
the task was completed, and the beauty looked
at her own reflection, a smile was forced to
play about her lips, for never had a mirror
reflected a vision more charming. Lady Betty,
with her rich coloring, her full white throat,
her perfect form, clad in a marvellous gown of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
white and silver, ruffled and ruffled with lace,
and looped up at one side a little to show the
blue petticoat; open, too, to show a neck as
white as snow,&mdash;and arms to match were half
revealed by the elbow sleeves, while her hat
cast a shadow on those sparkling eyes. She
gave the vision a look and then turned and
motioned Melissa away.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done very well, Thurle,&#8221; she
said calmly, &#8220;and now you may go&mdash;ah, here
is Alice!&#8221; and she relented at the sight of her
favorite attendant.</p>

<p>Melissa, meanwhile, humble as usual, courtesied
and withdrew, but not without casting a
lingering look behind her.</p>

<p>When the door closed, Lady Betty gave her
gown a few touches, turning around before the
mirror again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will I do, Alice?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Supremely well, madam,&#8221; Alice replied
soberly, standing off to view her with a critical
eye.</p>

<p>Lady Betty turned suddenly and laid her
hand on the girl&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hast said thy catechism, Alice?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>The handmaid looked up at her blankly,
her slower mind struggling to understand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>&#8220;What, my lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your catechism, goosie,&#8221; repeated Lady
Clancarty laughing; &#8220;did not my mother question
you close of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She did, madam,&#8221; retorted Alice bluntly,
with an ingenuous blush, &#8220;she asked me many
questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what answer did you give?&#8221; asked
her mistress smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Truthful answers, dear Lady Betty,&#8221; Alice
replied earnestly, apparently much troubled,
&#8220;save when I answered not at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not answer!&#8221; exclaimed her mistress,
in surprise, &#8220;and wherefore?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because she asked me what you said to
me of&mdash;of my Lord Clancarty,&#8221; stammered
Alice, &#8220;and, madam, that I will not tell!&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty laughed and blushed, and suddenly
she kissed the girl.</p>

<p class="ph3">AT THE RACES</p>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE was no finer race-course in the
country in those days than the long
heath at Newmarket, and there for
years the court of England kept festival.
Charles the Second came there, with a train
of gay and dissolute courtiers and fair, frail
women; there too came the more solemn
James with much the same following, if a more
decorous manner prevailed, and there came
that silent, collected, small man, whose body
so little expressed his soul,&mdash;one of the greatest
men of his time,&mdash;William the Third.</p>

<p>The king came to his summer palace, and
the great lords kept up their state about him.
Euston was famed for the balls of my Lord
Arlington in the days of Charles the Second,
and times were little changed in that respect.
In contrast to the courtly splendor, the heath
was fringed with an encampment as gay and
varied as any gypsy gathering. Here were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
people of all conditions: gypsies, in fact, in
their gay raiment, telling fortunes on the edge
of the throng, strolling players, dancing bears
and merry Andrews, and the farmers&#8217; families
come as to a festival to see the stream of
fashion. For here were all the great; even the
cockpit at noon was surrounded by stars and
ribbons, and there were hunting and hawking
and riding. There too were the long gowns
and black caps of the University dons, so well
received by William, mingling with the motley
throng. The world, melted down into this
little space, throbbed and bubbled like a cauldron
filled and boiling over, and never paused
except for the sermon on a Sunday.</p>

<p>At midday when the king went to the race-course
all Newmarket streamed out at his heels,
from the highest peers and greatest courtiers to
the pickpockets of London; from my Lord
of Devonshire to Captain Dick the horse
jockey; from an orange girl of Drury Lane
to the Princess of Denmark; the high and
the low, the rich man and the cutpurse, all
were there, and in that mass of many-colored
costumes, like a bed of King William&#8217;s tulips at
Loo, there were a thousand emotions,&mdash;hopes,
fears, hatreds, and ambitions. Money flowed
like water, and wagers ran high; fortunes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
made and unmade, and the faces of men and
women had often the tense expression of the
gambler. But whatever evil was there&mdash;and
much there was&mdash;was hidden under an air of
jollity, and the setting of the scene was as
variegated as a rainbow.</p>

<p>The long course was cleared for the horses,
and on either side, and especially about the
pavilion of the king, the crowd was packed
close, palpitating and murmuring in the sunshine,
white and pink, blue and crimson, green
and gold, ribbon upon ribbon of color, men
and women vying with each other in the brilliant
beauty and richness of apparel; and behind,
the great emblazoned coaches&mdash;drawn usually
by Flanders horses&mdash;stood tier upon tier,
sometimes empty, when their owners were
promenading, sometimes brimful of lovely
smiling faces and fluttering fans; and beyond
these, the farmers and teamsters, gypsies and
tipsters, honest men and thieves. Meanwhile
the jockeys rode their horses out upon the
turf for exercise and inspection; no people
loved a fine horse better than the English, and
it put the throng in an excellent humor.</p>

<p>In the midst of the satins and velvets, gold lace
and jewels, one small man was plainly dressed in
dark colors with a star upon his breast,&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
man with a pale, dark face and sparkling dark
eyes. Every head was bared before him, and
every great dame there courtesied almost to
the ground, and the trumpets sounded as King
William took his place. The warm September
air was filled with the hum of many voices, the
trampling of horses, the blare of military music,
and the great races began when the king quietly
waved his hand.</p>

<p>Lady Sunderland kept her seat in her own
carriage, and all the old beaux of the court
came there to pay their compliments and exchange
rare morsels of gossip with her ladyship,
whose wit was keen as her tongue was
merciless. But Lady Clancarty was not of this
party. She had left her seat in the gorgeously
emblazoned coach, and escorted by my Lord
of Devonshire himself, she made her way nearer
to the scene of action. Though she had lived
much at Althorpe, Lady Clancarty was not unknown,
and she was greeted on every hand as
she passed. Her beauty, her winning address,
the place her father occupied in the king&#8217;s favor,
made her at once the cynosure of all eyes. Old
beaux and young ones crowded forward for an
introduction. Devonshire stood near her,
Ormond and Bedford joined her coterie; in
fact, in two hours Lady Betty was the belle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Newmarket. She looked about her smiling,
roguish, keenly amused, and everywhere she
read approbation and admiration, not only in
the faces that she knew, but in the strange
ones. Everywhere men paid her homage;
over there the courtiers of the Princess Anne
were thinning out; the circle of my Lady Marlborough
grew narrower, but Lady Betty&#8217;s extended
like a whirlpool. In the midst of her
little triumph, she saw a tall man coming toward
her, singling her out amidst all the others; his
dress was plain and his periwig was of a different
fashion, but she could not mistake that eye
or that bearing; she had seen both in the
woods of Althorpe. In a moment more he
was bowing before her, and Ormond introduced
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Lady Betty, let me present
another admirer, Mr. Richard Trevor; an
Irishman as I would have your ladyship know,&#8221;
the duke added in her ear, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Lady Clancarty courtesied, casting a roguish
look at the stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith, we have met before, my lord,&#8221; she
said, and laughed softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twice before, my lady,&#8221; corrected Mr.
Trevor, smiling into her eyes.</p>

<p>Betty stared. &#8220;Once, sir,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>&#8220;As you will, Lady Clancarty,&#8221; he replied,
and smiled again, the dare-devil leaping up in
his gray eyes&mdash;and Betty blushed.</p>

<p>At the moment Lord Savile came up with
Mr. Benham.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you betting, Savile?&#8221; asked the Duke
of Devonshire, with a smiling glance at the
young man.</p>

<p>Savile made a wry face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound it, my lord, I&#8217;ve lost fifty
pounds on my mare, Lady Clara,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and Benham here has made a hundred on
that little black mare of Godolphin&#8217;s,&mdash;the
devil&#8217;s in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, look at them!&#8221; cried Betty, pointing
at the track, &#8220;they come flying like birds. Is
that your black mare in the lead, Mr. Benham?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hang for it, if he hasn&#8217;t won again,&#8221;
ejaculated Lord Savile, as they leaned forward
to watch the squad of horses coming in on the
home stretch.</p>

<p>There could scarcely be a finer sight: the
smooth turf, the shimmer of sunshine, the
beautiful animals running fleetly, for the joy
of it, heads out, eyes flashing fire, foam on
the lips, and manes flying, while the jockeys,
like knots of color, hung low over their necks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
The sharp clip of steel-shod feet, a stream of
color, sparks flying, and they were past, going
on to the stakes, while silence fell on the great
throng of people; men scarcely breathed, every
eye strained after them. Then suddenly a shout
of exultation and despair, strangely mingled,
and the whole crowd blossoming out into a mass
of waving handkerchiefs and tossing hats.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, was there ever anything so pretty!&#8221;
cried Lady Betty; &#8220;there is nothing finer than
a beautiful horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except a beautiful woman,&#8221; said my Lord
of Ormond gallantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray, my lord, do not put us in the same
category,&#8221; said Lady Betty laughing; &#8220;&#8217;tis
said that some men rate their horses dearer
than their wives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is because there are so few Lady
Clancartys,&#8221; replied Ormond smiling, and
Betty swept him a courtesy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benham&#8217;s won again,&#8221; remarked Savile,
too chagrined to notice anything else.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so have I,&#8221; said Mr. Trevor, with a
little smile; &#8220;&#8217;tis an ill wind that blows nobody
good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Savile eyed him from head to foot; his
quick ear had detected a peculiarity of voice
and accent.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>&#8220;Are you from Ireland, sir?&#8221; he asked
insolently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where gentlemen are bred,&mdash;yes, my
lord,&#8221; replied Trevor, his gray eyes gleaming
like steel.</p>

<p>Lady Betty stirred uneasily. &#8220;Whose horse
was that which came in last?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Savile&#8217;s,&#8221; laughed Benham, &#8220;don&#8217;t you
see his brow of thunder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard luck, my boy,&#8221; remarked Lord
Devonshire, smiling, &#8220;but there are many
here who will have worse to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, and the king&#8217;s cough is worse,&#8221; remarked
Ormond significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Radcliffe told him that he would not
have his two legs for his three kingdoms,&#8221; said
Lord Savile, with a sullen laugh.</p>

<p>Devonshire smiled a little and so did Ormond,
but Lady Betty looked straight before
her over the sunny turf.</p>

<p>&#8220;My Lord Savile,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the king has
the wisest head in Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A king is richest in the hearts that love
him,&#8221; said Richard Trevor smoothly, &#8220;and
the King of England is rich in these.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Betty darted a quick glance at him,
and so did my Lord of Ormond, but they read
nothing. It was a handsome, daring face, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
gray eyes and thin lips,&mdash;a face to fear in
anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are riddles and innuendoes everywhere,&#8221;
remarked Lord Savile with a shrug;
&#8220;one knows not how to read them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I say, I am quite ready to explain,
my lord,&#8221; Trevor replied smiling, his eyes
hard as flint.</p>

<p>As he spoke my Lady Sunderland came up
from her carriage, and with her two other dames
of fashion. In the stir and flutter of their
entrance, Lady Betty and the two young men,
Trevor and Lord Savile, were, to all intents
and purposes, alone, and she was perforce a
listener to their talk, which was by no means
friendly.</p>

<p>Lord Savile thrust his hands into his pockets.</p>

<p>&#8220;What flowers bloom at Saint Germain,
sir?&#8221; he asked, with a drawl.</p>

<p>&#8220;The poppies of Neerwinden, I am told,&#8221;
replied the Irishman.</p>

<p>Lord Savile&#8217;s face turned scarlet. &#8220;A very
vile joke, sir,&#8221; he said, in a low voice, &#8220;and
one you may repent of&mdash;here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I am in the society of informers&mdash;it
may be so,&#8221; replied Trevor haughtily and
very low, intending it only for my lord&#8217;s ear,
but Lady Betty heard it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>&#8220;I would fain walk a little way,&#8221; she said
suddenly, turning on them, &#8220;they will not
race again for half an hour, and I feel the heat
here. My Lord Savile, will you make way
for me through the crowd?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will, my lady,&#8221; Trevor said, offering his
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, sir,&#8221; retorted Savile, &#8220;I am the lady&#8217;s
friend, not you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trevor noticed him as little as a poodle; he
still smiled and offered his hand to Lady
Betty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Clancarty will choose, sir, not you,&#8221;
he said contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Clancarty will go with me,&#8221; cried
Savile, hotly and authoritatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith, she will not, sir,&#8221; said Betty laughing;
&#8220;Lady Clancarty will be commanded by
none, my lord, and Mr. Trevor will do her
this small service. But there are my thanks
for your kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she courtesied prettily before she laid
her hand lightly on the stranger&#8217;s arm and
moved at his side through the throng toward
the open heath beyond. Their progress was
necessarily slow, and followed by many admiring
glances, for the roses had deepened in
Lady Betty&#8217;s cheeks. The tall Irishman beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
her was no less a striking figure; his
height and proportions, the clean-cut face,
steel-gray eyes, and close-shut thin lips had a
history of their own; no one could doubt it.</p>

<p>As for Lord Savile, he stood fuming and
vowing vengeance on the cursed Irish Jacobite,
as he was pleased to name his rival; if a stanch
Whig hated any man, by instinct, he must
needs be a Papist and a Jacobite.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">LADY BETTY AND AN IRISH JACOBITE</p>


<p class="drop-cap2">LADY BETTY and her companion
walked on. The crowd, still huzzaing
and noisy about the victors, was
dropped behind them, all its gorgeous colors
knotted into one huge rosette upon the track;
beyond were green meadows and the blue
shadows of a grove of limes. The two walked
slowly, Lady Betty a little in advance, her long
skirts gathered in one hand, the other holding
her fan, the sun and the breeze kissing the
soft curves of her cheeks. Beside her, holding
his hat behind his back, was Richard
Trevor, his eyes on her, while hers were on the
landscape; the long, level stretch of turf, the
grove of limes, and farther off&mdash;veiled in
golden mist&mdash;the wavy outlines of forest and
hills. Above, the sky was blue&mdash;blue as
larkspur; the air was sweet too, as if the fragrance
of flowers floated on the soft September
breeze. A flock of pigeons, with the whir of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
many wings, rose from the ground as Betty
approached, and she looked up after them
and sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it true that the French king wears red
heels to his shoes?&#8221; she asked suddenly and
quite irrelevantly.</p>

<p>Mr. Trevor started perceptibly, giving her
a quizzical glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are frequently purple,&#8221; he replied,
with perfect gravity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because, I suppose, it is a royal color,&#8221;
she remarked absently; &#8220;you are a Jacobite,
Mr. Trevor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Either my disguise is a flimsy one, or
your penetration is great, Lady Clancarty,&#8221; he
replied, with a whimsical smile; &#8220;but I&#8217;ll
swear I&#8217;m not alone at Newmarket.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Betty elevated her brows a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been frequently hinted that King
William was one,&#8221; she remarked tranquilly.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the Whigs out of office,&#8221; he said, with
a short, hard laugh; &#8220;he is not counted one
on the Continent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or in Ireland,&#8221; she said; &#8220;you were at
Londonderry, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There were two sides to the wall at Londonderry,
my lady,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;I was on
one&mdash;I&#8217;ll admit that.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>&#8220;It is safe not to be explicit,&#8221; she said smiling;
&#8220;you are an Irishman, a Papist, and a
Jacobite,&#8221; she told off each point on her fingers,
&#8220;and you are from Munster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely,&#8221; said Mr. Trevor, with great
composure; &#8220;you have nailed me to the wall,
madam; I am a sinner of the blackest dye, a
subject for the gallows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I supposed,&#8221; she said cheerfully, nodding
her head at him, &#8220;and being all these
things, and from the Continent, can you tell
me&mdash;&#8221; for the first time she hesitated, stopped
short, looking at the turf under her daintily
shod feet, her face crimson.</p>

<p>He waited, smiling, composed, watchful;
not helping her by a word or sign, and she
could not read his eyes when she looked into
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know Lord Clancarty?&#8221; she asked
bluntly.</p>

<p>He took time to consider, studying, meanwhile,
every detail of her charming, ingenuous
face and perfect figure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have met him,&#8221; he said deliberately, &#8220;in
Dublin and in Paris.&#8221; Betty&#8217;s agitation was
quite apparent, but she commanded herself and
looked up bravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is my husband,&#8221; she said simply.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>Mr. Trevor smiled involuntarily.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a happy man,&#8221; he said gallantly.</p>

<p>She made an impatient gesture, laughing
and blushing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me how he looks?&#8221; she asked; &#8220;I
have never seen him since he was fifteen and
I eleven. Is he a bugbear? They would
have me believe so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, I have always thought
him handsome, my lady,&#8221; Mr. Trevor said,
smiling imperturbably, &#8220;and altogether the
most companionable man I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; she exclaimed; &#8220;yet you told
me you had only met him&mdash;twice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In two places,&#8221; corrected Mr. Trevor
quite unmoved, &#8220;but frequently. He&#8217;s a
fine man, madam, take my word for it; I
love him like a brother; he has only one
fault, madam, one sin, and that, I&#8217;ll admit, is
unpardonable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that?&#8221; she queried, with uplifted
brows, a little haughtily.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that,&#8221; replied Mr. Trevor calmly,
&#8220;is the fact that he has been able to live for
fourteen years without his wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Clancarty flushed angrily, and then
she laughed that delicious, mirthful laugh of
hers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>&#8220;He has existed, sir,&#8221; she corrected him,
&#8220;because he never knew how delightful Lady
Clancarty is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; replied Trevor, &#8220;a mere existence;
life uncrowned by love&mdash;such love as
he ought to have won, confound him&mdash;is not
life. He might as well be a turnip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I have always thought,&#8221; she replied,
with a charming smile; &#8220;but then, you know,
Mr. Trevor, he might not have been able to
win it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not win it!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;not win it,
when he is a husband to begin with. By Saint
Patrick, madam, I&#8217;d cut his acquaintance for
life! Not win it? What cannot a man do
under the inspiration of a beautiful and noble
woman? Kingdoms have been won and lost for
them. If Troy fell for Helen, an empire might
well fall for a woman as beautiful and far more
womanly. I&#8217;d run Clancarty through, my
lady, if he were not willing to die for his true
love. Irishmen are not made of such poor
stuff. No, no, he would win it, never fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Betty&#8217;s chin was up and her eyes travelling
over the green turf again.</p>

<p>&#8220;An idle boast, sir,&#8221; she said carelessly;
&#8220;no woman would be lightly won after years
of neglect.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>&#8220;Nor should be,&#8221; he replied, in a deep tone
of emotion, &#8220;nor should be! By the Virgin,
Clancarty ought to go on his knees from
Munster to Althorpe in penitence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith, what would he do about the Channel,
Mr. Trevor?&#8221; she asked wickedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Swim it, madam,&#8221; he replied promptly;
&#8220;a true man and a lover would not drown&mdash;with
such a saint enshrined before him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A Protestant saint for a Papist penitent,&#8221;
remarked Lady Betty smiling; &#8220;what a poor
consolation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Love laughs at obstacles, my Lady Clancarty,&#8221;
said Mr. Trevor, &#8220;and it forgets
creed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said and her brows went up.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one excuse, though,&#8221; he went on,
&#8220;one&mdash;or I would never speak to Donough
Macarthy again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there is one, then?&#8221; she asked doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;One&mdash;yes,&#8221; he replied gravely; &#8220;he is a
proscribed exile, madam, this king of yours
has excepted him from the Act of Grace; he
cannot return except, indeed, to the Tower
and the block. But, after all, to lose a head is
less than to lose a heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Betty laughed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>&#8220;Only one can recover a heart,&#8221; she said
wickedly, &#8220;but a head&mdash;I never heard of one
that was put on after the headsman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;but, after all, one
can die but once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And one can love many times,&#8221; suggested
Betty; &#8220;I have heard that my Lord Clancarty&#8217;s
heart is tender.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mere fables, madam,&#8221; he replied, with
cool mendacity; &#8220;his heart is made for one
image only and would keep that&mdash;to eternity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His must be a valuable and rare heart,&#8221;
Lady Clancarty remarked demurely, &#8220;too good,
sir, to exchange for a human one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Verily too good to give without a fair
exchange, madam,&#8221; he replied, smiling audaciously;
&#8220;nor will Clancarty cast it by the wayside.
I know him for a man who will love
and be loved again. He&#8217;s no moonstruck
youth, my lady; when he gives he will demand
a return.&#8221;</p>

<p>She carried her head proudly. &#8220;He should
have to win it,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;He would win it,&#8221; Trevor retorted boldly,
&#8220;and he would hold it. Pshaw, madam, I
despise a milksop, and so do you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are overbold in your assertions, sir,&#8221;
Betty said, stopping short and looking back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
over the heath, shading her eyes with her
fan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bold for a friend, my lady,&#8221; he said gracefully,
&#8220;bold for the absent who has none to
plead his cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Betty laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see that whirling, frantic thing
yonder?&#8221; she asked, pointing; &#8220;&#8217;tis my Lady
Sunderland&#8217;s India shawl; she is waving to
me. We must go back, sir; she thinks I
venture too near the lions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must go back, it seems, since you
command it,&#8221; he replied regretfully, &#8220;but I
may see Lady Clancarty again? I may speak
to her of&mdash;her husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty hesitated for the twentieth part of a
second and then she smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are at the Lion&#8217;s Head,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and I shall receive my friends after supper&mdash;but
do not talk of Lord Clancarty.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bowed profoundly, and she moved on,
for the India shawl was waving frantically now
and Savile and the others were coming toward
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you for the privilege,&#8221; said Richard
Trevor with his daring smile; &#8220;we will talk of
Lady Clancarty.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Betty answered not a word; she walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
back across the heath, proudly silent, nor did
she cast a single relenting glance behind her&mdash;and
thus failed to see the quizzical expression
in his eyes.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE WEARING OF THE GREEN</p>


<p class="drop-cap">THAT night was the night of Devonshire&#8217;s
great ball and all Newmarket
was agog, streets were blocked with
fours and sixes&mdash;the great coaches jammed in
rows, with fighting, swearing coachmen and
postilions. As for the chairs, they were blocked
in so closely that half the chairmen had black
eyes or bloody noses in the morning; and the
link-boys, let loose in this carnival, ran hither
and yon, with their lanthorns flaring in the
wind like ministering imps in an inferno, while
the country people and the tavern tipsters and
the market women filled up the last crevices,
to see beauty and fashion pass in and out the
flaring doorway, whence came strains of music
and the sounds of laughter. The king, it was
true, would not be there; his cough&mdash;or despatches
from France, it was whispered&mdash;would
keep him in bed that festive night, but Lady
Marlborough was there and in her train the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Princess Anne. People had begun already
to put the pair in this sequence, and laughed,
in their sleeves, at it and at William&#8217;s tolerance,
for no one despised my Lord Marlborough
more than that astute, cool-headed monarch,
who knew him to be as false as he was brilliant.</p>

<p>Excepting only the king himself, the whole
world of fashion was at the ball, and the house
was dressed with green boughs and flowers,
rushes and sweet seg, and a wassail bowl stood
in the hall wreathed with blossoms. The
band was stationed on the staircase landing,
the musicians clad for the occasion in scarlet
waistcoats and shorts, deep clocked scarlet
stockings, and coats of yellow velvet stamped
on the back with red roses and on the left
breast with the Devonshire arms. There
were female attendants, too, attired quaintly
in gay flowered silks and wearing vizards, who
served the fyne of pocras, sobyll bere and
mum below stairs, while above the rooms
were lighted by flambeaux and the floors
polished like mirrors for the dancers. There
were to be dances of every sort, from the
country romp, &#8220;cuckolds all awry,&#8221; with
&#8220;hoite come toite,&#8221; and the more stately
galliard, to &#8220;Trenchemore&#8221; and the cushion
dance and &#8220;tolly polly.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>Her Grace of Marlborough, in towering
headdress and a gown of red velvet over a
petticoat of cloth of gold, led the first dance
with his Grace of Devonshire, the Princess
Anne and the duke being <i>vis-à-vis</i>, but only a
poor spectacle by comparison.</p>

<p>The whole house overflowed with the
throng. The greatest of the court were
there, Bedford and Ormond and Hartington,&mdash;and
there, too, were Godolphin and Somers
and a bevy of beauty; ruffles of lace and
gleams of jewels, and here and there the rosy
cheeks of the daughters of the country squires.
Old dames looked on from the wall, smiling
and delighted when a daughter danced and
frowning at a more favored neighbor, and the
young beaux had no rest, but danced in their
tight French shoes and bowed until their backs
were doubled.</p>

<p>But the greatest stir was when Lady Clancarty
led the galliard with her noble host, my
lady all in white and gold, with one pink rose
in her hair, her eyes shining, and her cheeks
fresher than the rose. Down the long room
they came and her feet scarcely seemed to
touch the floor, and she held her head so high
that it almost overlooked his grace, who bowed
smilingly toward her, a stately figure himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
as he moved in his splendid dress down the
space left by the dancers, the music scarcely
drowning the murmur of applause. Her
Grace of Marlborough was outshone and she
bit her lip and tossed her head.</p>

<p>It was after this, when my Lady Clancarty,
flushed and lovely, stood surrounded by a
throng that the Irishman, Mr. Trevor, pushed
through them all to her side. A handsome
figure, too, and one which had won more than
one admiring glance that night; a graceful
figure clad in white satin, self-possessed,
accomplished. French in manner; he had
caught the trick at Versailles, and his gray
eyes looked straight into hers. The strains
of the dance floated up the stairs; my Lord
Savile pressed forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our dance, my lady,&#8221; he said, almost
imperatively thrusting between.</p>

<p>For an instant she hesitated and then she
smiled and laid her hand in Mr. Trevor&#8217;s,
so near that it brushed Savile&#8217;s sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8220;This dance is promised, my lord,&#8221; she
said sweetly, and passed out on the floor with
her partner.</p>

<p>The young lord swore in a subdued voice,
happily unheard by any one. All eyes were
on my lady and her partner.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>&#8220;What a pair!&#8221; they murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mars and Venus!&#8221; cried a courtier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Venus and Apollo!&#8221; said another, and
every eye was on them.</p>

<p>Yet the two thought not of it, they danced
superbly, it is true, and with a joy in it, being
adepts in the art, but Betty could think of no
one but the man who held her hand, whose
eyes held hers, too, by a spell. Perhaps, she
feared a little the mastery of his ways, yet she
had never danced before with such a partner.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have learned to dance in France, sir,
I think,&#8221; she said lightly, laughing a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; he replied, smiling too, &#8220;but I
think I learned on the mossy fields of old
Ireland, that I was born a dancer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Afterwards they went out on the balcony
together, the night air cooling their faces.
Below was the garden, for this was the rear of
the house. It was dark and silent without,
but the strains of music floated through the
open windows and the light from within fell
on her.</p>

<p>He took something from his breast and
pressing it to his lips, held it out to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you wear it, my lady,&#8221; he said softly,
&#8220;the symbol of an unfortunate country and&mdash;of
a loyal heart?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>She looked at it strangely, it was a piece of
shamrock. Perhaps she meant to refuse it,
but she saw Savile coming and a malicious imp
leaped into her eyes. She took it and tried to
fasten it in her hair but her fingers faltered,
and Savile drew nearer; the music, too,
heralded another dance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit me,&#8221; said Richard Trevor, and
deftly fastened the shamrock where the rose
had been, that slipped and fell between them
on the floor.</p>

<p>Lady Clancarty&#8217;s face was crimson. Trevor
knelt on one knee and taking up the rose
kissed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fair exchange,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She bit her lip and stretched out her hand
to snatch the flower.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will dance with me now, my lady?&#8221;
said Lord Savile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were long in coming,&#8221; replied her
ladyship wickedly, with mock eagerness, but
not without a backward glance to see the effect
of it; but the coquette was disappointed.</p>

<p>At her words, the Irishman let her flower
lie where it had fallen, and in a few minutes
she saw him dancing with the pretty daughter
of a country squire. Lady Clancarty liked it
so little that she set her teeth on her lip and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
gave my Lord Savile a bit of her temper. Yet
she wore the shamrock, though half the room
began to comment upon it.</p>

<p>It was morning when the great rout broke
up and the stream of coaches began to move
again. The crowd had stayed; they knew my
lord duke&#8217;s generosity and that the broken
meats from that fête would keep them for a
sevennight, and they waited to pour at last
into the kitchenway and come out heavy-laden;
they were there when the great people went
away in their coaches and chairs.</p>

<p>Lady Sunderland was already in her chair
and her daughter was coming down the stair
with a throng of followers, but it was Richard
Trevor who walked beside her.</p>

<p>&#8220;The rose I would not take from the
ground,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;I am no beggar of
crumbs&mdash;but the shamrock&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled and her bright eyes looked beyond
him at the throng below.</p>

<p>&#8220;The shamrock!&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>It was not in her hair; had she thrown it
away? A step lower down and she held out
her hand and dropped the sprig into his.</p>

<p>&#8220;A poor thing, sir, but &#8217;tis yours,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;and you were long in claiming it,&#8221; she
added, laughing softly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>At the moment a wreath of flowers, cast
from the balcony above, fell lightly on her
shoulders, and she stood laughing, the petals
showering her and falling all about her feet.</p>

<p>He kissed her finger tips gallantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Queen of the Rout is crowned!&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p class="ph3">AN IRISH DEFIANCE</p>


<p class="drop-cap">MELISSA stood meekly before her
mistress.</p>

<p>&#8220;My Lady Sunderland&#8217;s compliments,
madam,&#8221; she said, with her usual purr;
&#8220;will you play basset to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Lady Clancarty; &#8220;many
thanks; but tell my mother that I am to have
guests, and my purse is too thin for basset.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the door closed on Melissa, Lady Clancarty
rose from her dressing-table.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will wear the pink flowered brocade,
Alice,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Alice opened her eyes. &#8220;Oh, my lady,&#8221;
she remonstrated, &#8220;it is too lovely; I thought
you meant it only for the king&#8217;s levees.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her mistress smiled. &#8220;May not the king
come here&mdash;if he chooses?&#8221; she said mischievously.
&#8220;The brocade, Alice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unconvinced, Alice brought the garment,
a beautiful and costly thing frosted with rare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
lace, and as she helped Lady Betty put it on
she was more and more impressed with its
charms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my lady,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;you do
look lovely in it&mdash;&#8217;tis too fine by half.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty craned her neck backward, looking
over her shoulder into the glass; the folds of
the sheeny satin fell about her, the bodice
fitted like a glove, displaying every curve of
her well-rounded form, and it was low cut,
revealing a neck and shoulders like snow.
The beauty smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring me my string of pearls,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Alice brought them without a word and
helped her fasten them about her throat.
Betty looked into the mirror again and then
fell to fingering the bracelet on one round arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alice,&#8221; she said, half laughing, &#8220;he is here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The handmaid started, looking at her in
wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who, my lady?&mdash;not Lord Clancarty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The stranger we met in the woods at
Althorpe,&#8221; her mistress replied, &#8220;who would
have kissed me for a milkmaid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, madam, I think he would as lief
kiss you as a queen,&#8221; Alice said blushing,
&#8220;the bold gallant! He is here&mdash;and who
is he?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>Lady Clancarty clasped and unclasped her
bracelet while the roses deepened in her cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is called Richard Trevor,&#8221; she said
softly; &#8220;a pretty name, Alice, Richard&mdash;rich-hearted,
lion-hearted&mdash;like our great
Plantagenet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice looked at her in bewilderment. Lady
Betty had as many moods as April: did she
mean to fall in love, at last, after all her loyalty
to that unknown and terrible exile? Alice
wondered. But saying nothing she stooped
down, instead, to smooth the shining folds of
the beautiful gown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go fix the candles, Alice,&#8221; Lady Clancarty
said, with a soft little sigh, &#8220;and place a
table for cards&mdash;and the lute and guitar&mdash;place
them there also. Presently my guests
will be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The handmaid obeyed, too perplexed by
this new mood of my lady&#8217;s to venture on the
smallest observation. She had arranged the
room with simple taste when Lady Betty
entered it a few moments later. It was not as
large a room as her mother&#8217;s, but it was furnished,
too, with an open fireplace where a
single log burned, for the nights were chilly.
Candles were set on the mantel and the table,
while through the open door came the buzz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of conversation, for Lady Sunderland was
deep in a game of basset with Lady Dacres
and his Grace of Bedford. Betty did not disturb
them but observed them from a distance,
noticing her mother&#8217;s rouged face and nodding
headdress, and Lady Dacres&#8217;s pinched and
eager features. The old dame was as keen
as any gamester. The mother and daughter
had so little in common that they seemed like
strangers, and the younger countess stood
looking at the log in deep thought when
Richard Trevor was announced. As she
courtesied, she gave him a quick, keen glance,
but made nothing of that bold handsome face
of his, though quick to note the distinction
of his appearance and bearing, those of a man
used to courts as well as camps. She saw it
all at a glance, as she had seen it at first, but
she chose to receive him with cool politeness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You play basset, of course, sir?&#8221; she said
demurely.</p>

<p>But he saw the pitfall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m too poor, madam,&#8221; he replied smiling.
&#8220;I can remember hearing an old courtier tell
how he lost his fortune to King Charles at
basset.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust the king gave it back to him,&#8221; she
said quickly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>&#8220;He made him a lottery cavalier,&#8221; rejoined
Mr. Trevor calmly.</p>

<p>Betty smiled scornfully. &#8220;And for such
a king men have died!&#8221; she said significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ingratitude is only human at the worst,&#8221;
he replied, laughing softly, &#8220;and you know,
&#8216;the king can do no wrong!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Betty put her finger on her lip, with a
glance toward the card-players.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; he said, regardless of her
caution, &#8220;&#8217;tis quite useless to die for any
king. There is only one thing worth dying
for, and that&mdash;is supremely worth living for,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it is not a king?&#8221; she commented
thoughtfully, &#8220;or a queen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A queen, yes,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;but the
queen of hearts. The only thing worth living
for,&#8221; he said, and his voice grew deep and
tender, &#8220;and dying for, my Lady Clancarty,
is&mdash;Love.&#8221;</p>

<p>She blushed and her eyes fell. He had the
most compelling glance she had ever encountered.
Those eyes of his would enthrall hers,
and she looked away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard of any man dying of it,&#8221;
she remarked, with a bitter little laugh.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>&#8220;That&#8217;s because a wise man would rather
live for it,&#8221; he said; &#8220;what exquisite torment
for a man to die and leave it behind him&mdash;in
the shape of a lovely widow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Lady Betty, with a roguish
smile, &#8220;therein lies the sting!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely,&#8221; admitted the Irishman; &#8220;if
there&#8217;s one thing that could bring me back to
this vale of tears it is my successor!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard that in India the widows are
burnt on the funeral pyres,&#8221; she remarked, a
glow of amusement in her eyes; &#8220;you might
arrange it so for the future Mrs. Trevor.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head disconsolate. &#8220;She&#8217;s
sure to be a woman of spirit,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I
couldn&#8217;t get her consent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty shrugged her shoulders. &#8220;After all
you have said of love you can&#8217;t find a woman
to die for it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather she lived for it,&#8221; he said,
with his daring smile, &#8220;and for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Men are purely selfish,&#8221; she retorted
with fine indifference, &#8220;it&#8217;s always &#8216;for
me&#8217;; hadn&#8217;t you better dream of living for
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do!&#8221; he replied promptly; &#8220;faith, if I
didn&#8217;t dream of her I should immediately
expire&mdash;she&#8217;s the star of my life.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Lady Betty, in a strange voice,
&#8220;it has gone as far as that?&mdash;she is French,
I suppose?&#8221; she added with polite interest
and elevated brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never inquire into the nationality of
divinities,&#8221; he said coolly; &#8220;she&#8217;s an angel,
and that&#8217;s enough for her humble adorer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You Papists are fond of saints,&#8221; remarked
my lady, tapping the floor with her foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;And sinners,&#8221; he admitted.</p>

<p>Betty turned her shoulder toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What color are her eyes?&#8221; she asked,
playing with her fan.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t look into them at this moment,&#8221;
he replied with audacity, &#8220;but I hope to tell
you later.&#8221;</p>

<p>She flashed a withering glance at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are brown,&#8221; he announced coolly.</p>

<p>Anger and amusement struggled for a
moment on Lady Betty&#8217;s face, and then she
laughed and dropped her fan.</p>

<p>He stooped to pick it up and something
green and shrivelled fell before her. Lady
Betty put her foot on it. He handed her
the fan with a bow. The voices in the other
room rose a little in a dispute.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they saying?&#8221; she asked, swaying
her fan before her face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>He listened and smiled. &#8220;They are talking
of Lady Horne&#8217;s divorce,&#8221; he said; &#8220;what is
your ladyship&#8217;s view of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated&mdash;and there is a proverb!</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a Papist,&#8221; she said, &#8220;do you believe
that a marriage&mdash;even a foolish one&mdash;is
indissoluble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I do,&#8221; he replied piously; &#8220;perish
the thought of severing the tie!&#8221;</p>

<p>She reddened.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, &#8217;tis &#8216;for better or for worse&#8217;!&#8221; she
said bitterly, &#8220;and usually for worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Until death us do part,&#8217;&#8221; he quoted
piously again.</p>

<p>Lady Betty started and turned from red to
white.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a horrible idea,&#8221; she said, with a
shudder,&mdash;Lord Sunderland would have heard
her with amazement,&mdash;&#8220;no escape for a poor
woman who has been ensnared into a wretched
union!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A wretched union,&#8221; he repeated slowly, a
change coming over his face, &#8220;a wretched
union; are all marriages so wretched, my
lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A great many of them,&#8221; she retorted tartly,
and he could only see the curve of her white
shoulder and the back of her head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>He knelt on one knee and began to look
around on the floor with an anxious face.
After a moment she looked at him over her
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she asked, blushing and biting
her lip.</p>

<p>&#8220;My shamrock,&#8221; he said, peeping under the
table with an air of perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you always carry vegetables with you?&#8221;
she asked witheringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have&mdash;since last night,&#8221; he retorted,
still searching.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you dropped it here?&#8221; she asked
innocently.</p>

<p>He passed his sword under a chair and drew
it back slowly over the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied, in a tone of deep anxiety,
&#8220;&#8217;twas here.&#8221;</p>

<p>She moved to the other side of the fireplace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that it?&#8221; she asked, coolly pointing.</p>

<p>He pounced upon the withered sprig and
kissed it, and rising stood looking at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; he said, and a daring smile played
about his mouth; he took a step nearer, &#8220;but
some marriages are made&mdash;in heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And others&mdash;&#8221; Lady Clancarty pointed
downward with a wicked smile.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;those are of earth,
earthy; but when love steps in, then, my
lady, then&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There comes my Lord Savile,&#8221; she said,
and smiled sweetly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn him!&#8221; he muttered beneath his
breath.</p>

<p>The door opened to admit Lord Savile and
Mr. Benham, and her greeting was cordiality
itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a gentleman who has staked all his
fortune on his gray mare and lost it!&#8221; Mr.
Benham said, his hand on Savile&#8217;s shoulder,
&#8220;and he has done nothing but weep for
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Saint Thomas!&#8221; exclaimed that nobleman,
&#8220;I&#8217;m not the first to stake all on a woman and
lose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave the saint out of it, my lord, when
you put the sinner in,&#8221; said Lady Betty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Saint Mary, there goes my last
crown!&#8221; came from the other room in the
shrill lament of Lady Dacres.</p>

<p>Both Savile and Trevor laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Change the sex of your saint and you have
an honorable example,&#8221; remarked Trevor, as
he picked up the countess&#8217; guitar and began to
finger it lightly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;m a ruined man,&#8221; said Savile recklessly,
&#8220;unless that fickle dame&mdash;Fortune&mdash;smiles
on me to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to call her a fickle mare, my
lord,&#8221; suggested Lady Betty artlessly; &#8220;when
Fortune runs upon four legs it must needs be
more fleet than upon two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Savile looked into her eyes with a
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;If love were kind, fortune might fly, my
lady,&#8221; he said daringly, but very low.</p>

<p>Lady Clancarty flushed hotly as she turned
to greet a newcomer, Sir Edward Mackie, one
of Devonshire&#8217;s gentlemen; a young fellow
with a round, boyish face, who had worn his
heart upon his sleeve until he lost it to Lady
Betty. But so ingenuous was he, so frankly
generous and devoted, that she gave him now
her sweetest smile.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Trevor still tuned the
guitar, but he had heard Savile&#8217;s whisper to my
lady and had watched her face with keen and
searching eyes. Young Mackie brought news
for Lady Clancarty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your brother has come,&#8221; he said eagerly,
&#8220;my Lord Spencer; I have just had the honor
to wait upon him. Very proud I am too, my
lady, for is he not one of the new lights of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
party, and one of the most learned young men
in Britain?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrugged her white shoulders laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is all that, Sir Edward,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
more&mdash;much more,&#8221; she added with a droll
expression of despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much learning doth make him mad,&#8221; said
Mr. Trevor smiling. &#8220;I have known such
cases on the Continent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis instructive,&#8221; Betty admitted, smiling
at Sir Edward&#8217;s boyish face, &#8220;but &#8217;tis
dry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me a fine horse, a fine woman, and
fine music, and all the books in England might
burn,&#8221; said Benham.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Lady Betty, and she lifted her
brows with a contemptuous glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;In sequence, according to your valuation
of them, sir,&#8221; remarked Mr. Trevor, with a
cool smile, &#8220;a poor compliment to the sex.
But music expresses something&mdash;something
only&mdash;of the beauty and charm of a fair
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sing to us, do!&#8221; interposed the countess,
&#8220;I despise comparisons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To hear is to obey, my lady,&#8221; he replied,
beginning at once to play the sad wild air that
made her start and change color.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>Would he dare to sing that here? she
thought, her heart beating hard; would he dare?
How little she knew him! In a moment his rich
tenor voice, a voice of peculiar charm and
timbre, filled the room and even startled the
card-players.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;&#8217;Tis you shall reign alone,</div>
<div class="indent1">My dark Rosaleen!</div>
<div class="indent1">My own Rosaleen!</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Tis you shall have the golden throne,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Tis you shall reign, and reign alone,</div>
<div class="indent1">My dark Rosaleen!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>He sang the wild ballad through to the end,
and as he ceased, Lady Betty turned to him
and smiled, applauding softly. But she said
nothing, although young Mackie was openly
delighted, and Lady Sunderland exclaimed that
it was a marvellous fine performance of a poor
song.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis an old ballad, madam,&#8221; Mr. Trevor
replied courteously, &#8220;and perhaps a poor one,
but dear to the Irish heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sing an English one next time, sir, or a
Dutch&mdash;la&mdash;yes, your Grace of Bedford, we
grow to love everything Dutch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Savile meanwhile, with his hands
thrust into his pockets and his face flushed,
lounged nearer to the singer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>&#8220;A very pretty performance,&#8221; he said, with
an insolent drawl, &#8220;worthy a tavern musician.
By Jove, sir, the tune is pestiferous here; an
Irishman and a cow-stealer are synonymous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Richard Trevor smiled, his gray eyes flashing
dangerously.</p>

<p>&#8220;And English noblemen are often cowards,
and liars to boot, sir,&#8221; he said in an undertone,
his hand still on the guitar.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am at your service,&#8221; said Savile, in a
passionate voice.</p>

<p>Trevor glanced warningly at Lady Clancarty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Elsewhere, my lord, with pleasure,&#8221; he
said, still smiling, &#8220;I might add with joy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Sunderland came in now with her
guests; she had won at basset and was in high
good humor.</p>

<p>&#8220;A song,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;another song.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes sought Trevor and he bowed
gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;At another time, my lady,&#8221; he said; &#8220;now
I must wait on a friend, who has the first
claim upon me. My ladies all, good-night,&#8221;
and he bowed gracefully, a certain merry defiance
in his glance.</p>

<p>Lady Betty held out her hand involuntarily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you for the ballad,&#8221; she said and
smiled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>He carried her hand to his lips and, it may
be, kissed it with more fervor than courtesy
required, for the rosy tide swept over her
white neck and her cheeks and brow.</p>

<p>As he went out, Lady Sunderland tapped
her fan upon her lips. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell it,&#8221; she
said, with the coquetry of a girl of sixteen,
&#8220;don&#8217;t tell it, but la!&mdash;he has the finest
figure I ever saw, and the legs of an Apollo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pon my soul, madam, that&#8217;s a compliment
that&#8217;s worth dying for,&#8221; Mr. Benham
said, with a peculiar smile at Savile.</p>

<p>Betty seeing it, went over and stood staring
into the embers on the hearth, though she
pretended to be talking to young Mackie.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">A NIGHT OF PORTENTS</p>


<p class="drop-cap2">ALICE was combing Lady Betty&#8217;s hair
late that night.</p>

<p>The two girls were in Betty&#8217;s bedroom,
a solitary taper burning on the table.
In this rosy twilight both faces showed indistinctly.
Betty&#8217;s finery lay upon a chair near
by; she wore only a flowing white robe over her
night-rail, and one rosy foot, out of the slipper,
rested on the rug. Her luxuriant hair falling
about her almost hid her face, and her eyes
were fixed pensively upon the fire. Meanwhile,
Alice stood behind her combing and
brushing her hair with hands that actually trembled,
while her face was very white. If Lady
Clancarty had looked at her, she would have
divined some trouble, but as it was she was
only aroused from her revery by the girl&#8217;s
unwonted awkwardness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, Alice!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;that is
the third time you have pulled my hair. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
shall be as bald soon as Lady Dacres without
her perukes. What ails you, girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m nervous,&#8221; Alice said, her voice breaking
suspiciously, &#8220;I can&#8217;t help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Betty tossed back her hair, snatched
up a taper and looked at her sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nervous?&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;why, you are
naturally as tame as any barnyard fowl. Nervous!
Why, your eyes are sticking out of your
head. What is it, girl? Hast met your friend
the parson again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; faltered Alice, with a little sob.
&#8220;I&mdash;I overheard some talk between two gentlemen
to-night in the hall&mdash;and it scared me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty laughed merrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fie, Alice, fie!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;an eavesdropper!
What horrible thing was it they said?
Mercy on us, girl, you look as if they plotted
bloody murder!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So they did, madam,&#8221; Alice said soberly.</p>

<p>Lady Betty stared.</p>

<p>&#8220;The child&#8217;s demented,&#8221; she remarked,
shaking her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;That I&#8217;m not,&#8221; Alice replied bluntly,
wiping a tear from her pale cheek, &#8220;but I hate
to think of one of them dead&mdash;for some folly,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ho!&#8221; said her mistress, setting down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the taper, &#8220;now I understand&mdash;there is to be
a duel;&#8221; then suddenly her mood changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who were they?&#8221; she demanded sharply.</p>

<p>Alice began to show reluctance and her eyes
avoided Betty&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two guests of the inn, madam,&#8221; she said,
averting her face.</p>

<p>But Lady Clancarty caught her arm and
turned her to the light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out with it, Alice,&#8221; she said imperiously,
&#8220;I will know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Lord Savile,&#8221; the girl said slowly,
&#8220;and&mdash;and another&mdash;a stranger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our stranger of Althorpe, Alice?&#8221; Lady
Betty said, a sudden indefinable change in her
whole aspect.</p>

<p>Alice nodded sullenly.</p>

<p>Her mistress stood quite still for a moment,
pressing her hands together. She had shaken
her hair about her face again, so that it was
concealed. There was something in her attitude
so unusual, in the silence, too, of the room,
where only the fire crackled, and in the girl&#8217;s
own nervousness, that quite overcame Alice.
She began to cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;They fight to-morrow,&#8221; she sobbed, &#8220;in the
meadow beyond the grove of limes&mdash;at sunrise.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>&#8220;Who are their seconds?&#8221; Lady Betty
asked, in a strangely quiet tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Benham, so I heard them say, and a
young fellow with a face like a boy. He was
to act for the stranger because he had no
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Young Mackie!&#8221; said Lady Clancarty.
&#8220;You heard this and did not tell me, Alice? I
find it hard to forgive you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should I?&#8221; cried Alice trembling,
&#8220;what could your ladyship do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty gave a strange little laugh. &#8220;You shall
see what I will do to-morrow,&#8221; she said quietly,
&#8220;for you shall go with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go where, my lady?&#8221; Alice asked in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the meadow behind the limes,&#8221; replied
her mistress calmly; &#8220;there I shall go to-morrow,
at sunrise, and stop this folly. It
began in my rooms, Alice, over a ballad, and I
have no mind that it shall end in bloodshed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, madam, I think you are in the
right,&#8221; said Alice simply, &#8220;but what can we do?
They will never listen to a woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Clancarty shut her lips firmly, and held
her little bare foot out to the fire, warming it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear you cannot stop them,&#8221; Alice went
on; &#8220;Lord Savile was very fierce, but the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
gentleman&mdash;oh, madam, I feared him more!
he was so cool; and those eyes of his&mdash;they
are like steel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So they are,&#8221; said Betty absently, &#8220;and
hath he not a handsome face?&#8221; and she looked
pensively into the fire. &#8220;To-morrow we shall
go, Alice, to-morrow at sunrise, and I shall stop
this duel&mdash;I will stop it, if I have to go to the
king!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the little handmaid did not reply; she
was watching her mistress with an anxious face.
She did not know the meaning of this new
Lady Betty, and some hint of impending
trouble weighed upon her. She was country
bred, too, and timid, and the thought of the
gray dawn with the shadowy trees looming
through the mist and only the flash of steel to
illumine the scene, made her tremble. But
Betty, usually so observant and sympathetic
and light hearted, did not heed her; she was
suddenly self-absorbed, pensive, quietly determined.
She went to the window and peeped
out into the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many hours until sunrise, Alice?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Six, my lady,&#8221; the girl replied with a sigh,
&#8220;and I wish it might be sixteen!&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty laughed, a strange little embarrassed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
laugh, coming back and sinking on her knees
before the hearth, the firelight playing on her
lovely face, and the shadowy masses of her hair,
and the gleaming white of her draperies.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot sleep,&#8221; she said softly; &#8220;I cannot
sleep&mdash;I am not fit for a soldier&#8217;s wife!&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice shuddered. &#8220;Indeed, my lady, I&#8217;d
as lief marry a butcher!&#8221; she cried, with such
genuine horror and disgust that she moved her
mistress to merriment.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, my girl, I told you so,&#8221; cried Lady
Betty, &#8220;you were meant for that same parson.&#8221;</p>

<p class="ph3">MASTER AND MAN</p>


<p class="drop-cap">MEANWHILE, under the same roof,
but in far different quarters, the
young Irishman called Richard
Trevor was talking to his servant, the same
who had led his horse up and down in the inn-yard
under Lady Betty&#8217;s window. The room&mdash;an
attic one&mdash;was scarcely ten feet square,
and almost devoid of furniture; there was a
pallet, a table, and two chairs; and a mat of
braided straw at the foot of the master&#8217;s bed
served for the man&#8217;s. A single candle burned
low in its socket on the table, and here Richard
Trevor sat with some writing materials before
him, but he was not writing; he leaned back
in his chair and listened, with his amused
smile, to the glib talk of his attendant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faix, sir, they be afther charging more here
for a bite of mate or a dhrap of liquor thin in
anny ither place in th&#8217; kingdom,&#8221; said the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
dolefully; &#8220;I&#8217;ve bin afther minding yer lordship&#8217;s
insthructions about the money, an&#8217; by
the Powers, me stomach is loike to clave to
me backbone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can starve respectably, however, Denis,&#8221;
said his master smiling, and turning the contents
of his purse out on the table; &#8220;a small sum
for our needs, but it must serve,&#8221; he added,
counting the money with a reckless air; &#8220;besides,
one of us may die before we come to the
end of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be afther doin&#8217; it here, yer honor,&#8221;
said Denis gloomily, &#8220;from an impty stomach.
Betwane th&#8217; landlord an&#8217; the ranting, tearing
Whig gintry in th&#8217; stable-yard, sir, I&#8217;m clane
daft.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So they&#8217;re all for the king in possession,
are they?&#8221; said Trevor, in an amused tone;
&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ve heeded my instructions to
keep your tongue quiet in your head and mind
your own business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Faix, me lord, I&#8217;ve bin afther minding
mine, but they&#8217;re afther minding it too, th&#8217;
ill-favored thribe!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is because you are an Irishman,
Denis; they know that at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indade, yer lordship&#8217;s mistaken intirely;
they&#8217;ve no idee at all that I&#8217;m a Munster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
man,&#8221; said his servant, with an air of satisfaction,
&#8220;divil a bit of it! Sometimes I&#8217;m a
Frenchy an&#8217; sometimes I&#8217;m a Dutchy&mdash;but
an Irishman niver! Lady Clancarty&#8217;s woman&mdash;a
sly divil with a pair of eyes that be winking
etarnally&mdash;she&#8217;s bin swate to me. By the
Virgin, sir, she&#8217;s bin afther thryin&#8217; to sound
me about yer lordship. She looks at me and
purrs, for all th&#8217; wurruld, loike a big white
tabby, an&#8217; says she, &#8216;You&#8217;re an Irishman,
sir!&#8217; &#8216;Divil a bit, me darlint,&#8217; says I, &#8216;I&#8217;m a
Dutchman, born at th&#8217; Hague and me mither
was forty-first cousin, wanst removed, to th&#8217;
king&#8217;s grandmither,&#8217; says I. &#8216;Ye don&#8217;t tell
me!&#8217; says she, and her little pale eyes blinked
loike a candle in th&#8217; wind. &#8216;An&#8217; what&#8217;ll be
yer name, sir?&#8217; she asks, as swate as honey.
&#8216;Mynheer Tulipius,&#8217; says I, for I couldn&#8217;t
think of anither name for th&#8217; life of me. &#8216;La,
sir,&#8217; says she with a simper, &#8216;you look loike a
tulip, to be shure.&#8217; &#8216;So I do, me darlint,&#8217; I replied,
and I thried to make up me mind to kiss
her, but, bedad, sir, I couldn&#8217;t do it; there&#8217;s
something about her that sinds the cowld
creeps up me spine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a great coward, Denis,&#8221; said his
master smiling, &#8220;afraid of a woman! It&#8217;s a
new fault in you, and one that I did not expect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
As for this creature, what were her
questions about me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yer master&#8217;s an Irishman, Mynheer Tulipius,&#8217;
says she, &#8216;that we all know fer a fact.&#8217;
&#8216;Is he, indade?&#8217; says I, with the greatest
amazement; &#8216;&#8217;tis the first time I iver heard
it,&#8217; says I; &#8216;he was born in London and his
fayther was one of Gineral Cromwell&#8217;s Ironsides.&#8217;
&#8216;Ye don&#8217;t say so,&#8217; says she, &#8216;how iver
did he get on so well at Saint Germain thin?&#8217;
and she blinked a hundred times in a second.
&#8216;Saint Germain!&#8217; says I, opening my eyes
wide; &#8216;indade, they were so cowld to him there
that he was afther laving before he got there,&#8217;
says I, &#8216;it&#8217;s quite well known,&#8217; I wint on, as
slick as silk, &#8216;that whin the man Jimmy Stuart,
rayalized that my masther was in France he
put on a shirt of mail an&#8217; niver took it off at
all, even av he was aslape in his ruffled silk
night-rail, for fear he&#8217;d be kilt on th&#8217; field of
honor.&#8217; &#8216;Is that so?&#8217; says she; &#8216;an&#8217; thin
p&#8217;r&#8217;aps ye&#8217;ve met me Lord Clancarty out
there?&#8217; &#8216;Clancarty?&#8217; says I, squinting hard
with wan eye, &#8216;there was a gintleman of that
same name hung jist as I was afther laving
Holland&mdash;mebbe he&#8217;s yer friend?&#8217; By
Saint Patrick, me lord, you ought to have
sane her stare! She sthopped winking thin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
an&#8217; looked loike a cat that&#8217;s sane a bird; on
me sowl, sir, I looked to see av there wasn&#8217;t a
furry tail swinging behind, to wurk th&#8217; charm
on me. &#8216;Clancarty hung?&#8217; says she, clapping
her hand to her heart, &#8216;what for?&#8217; &#8216;Faix, I
don&#8217;t know, me darlint,&#8217; says I, &#8216;unless it was
for being too much of a Whig.&#8217; &#8216;Pshaw!&#8217;
cries she, stamping her foot, &#8216;ye&#8217;re a paddy
fool!&#8217; &#8216;Niver a bit,&#8217; says I, &#8216;I&#8217;m a Dutch
wizard, me darlint; just let me be afther telling
yer fortune.&#8217; But away she wint in a towering
rage, an&#8217; left me with me heart broken intirely
at the siparation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear you did not deceive her,&#8221; said Clancarty,
with a laugh, and he unsheathed his
sword, running his finger along the blade.
&#8220;My old friend needs polishing, Denis,&#8221; he
added, with his careless air of good humor,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve a duel on my hands for the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Irishman&#8217;s face sobered in an instant,
and he cast a look of concern at his master.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorra for it, me lord,&#8221; he said, with
an honest ring in his voice, &#8220;ye&#8217;ve no friends
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except you, Denis,&#8221; said his master kindly,
&#8220;and if I fall, all my effects are yours&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221;
he paused an instant and then laughed
recklessly, &#8220;and you can tell the widow.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>&#8220;She&#8217;s a foine lady, me lord,&#8221; said Denis
artfully, &#8220;&#8217;tis a pity to throw away yer life
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a woman to die for, Denis,&#8221; exclaimed
his lord, a sudden glow passing over
his face; &#8220;but I shall not die&mdash;faith, I&#8217;ve
fought too many duels to die in one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s always loike to be wan too many,
yer honor,&#8221; said Denis gravely, &#8220;and wan
thrust of th&#8217; sword and th&#8217; house of Macarthy
loses its head.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man laughed recklessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And a beggarly exile dies,&#8221; he said bitterly.
&#8220;I fear you are not a man of courage, Denis;
I think I&#8217;ve heard of you in the retreat from
Boyne,&#8221; he added, with a laughing glance at
the dark-faced, sturdy Irishman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, sir, that was the fault of me shoes,
an&#8217; I blush for it,&#8221; Denis replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your shoes,&#8221; repeated his master, &#8220;and
wherefore your shoes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas afther this fashion, me lord,&#8221; said
Denis gravely; &#8220;there was a scamp of a shoemaker
in Dublin that was accused, an&#8217; rightly
as I b&#8217;lave, of being allied with the Powers of
Darkness, and he was afther making me shoes.
About that time money was scarce, sir, as ye
know, in spite of King James&#8217;s brass pieces, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
it was glad I was to get the shoes at all, without
bein&#8217; over an&#8217; above particular about the
maker. So whin Danny O&#8217;Toole says to me
that he&#8217;ll make me a blooming pair of boots
an&#8217; thrust me fer the money, niver a thought
had I av the divilish plot he was afther laying
aginst me honor. &#8216;Make &#8217;em aisy,&#8217; says I,
&#8216;for me feet are sore with the chasing of the
English an&#8217; the Dutch.&#8217; &#8216;Don&#8217;t ye worry,&#8217;
says he with a wink, &#8216;I&#8217;ll make &#8217;em so aisy
they&#8217;ll walk off without ye,&#8217;&mdash;and faith, so
he did! They were the beautifullest shoes,
me lord, and they fitted me loike the skin on
a potaty, and as fer walking in &#8217;em, they niver
touched the ground unless they stuck fast in a
bog, and that wasn&#8217;t often. I niver had such
a pair of shoes, nor such comfort, and all wint
along as smooth as lying&mdash;until that cursed
day of the battle of Boyne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A day when a good many Irishmen had
no shoes, Denis,&#8221; remarked his master, &#8220;or
lost them in running&mdash;to our eternal shame!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t what happened to me, my
lord,&#8221; said Denis regretfully; &#8220;&#8217;twas a black
day fer Ireland; yer lordship niver spake a
thruer word! But, as fer me, my shoes had
bin running away from me so&mdash;the very divil
seemed to be in &#8217;em&mdash;that I cut some stout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
thongs of hide and bound those boots to me
legs before I wint into the battle, fer, thought
I, av I don&#8217;t I&#8217;ll be afther losing them, the
jewels! I was right in the thick of it, an&#8217; a
hot day it was, as yer honor knows, and but for
that divil of a Dutchman that they call king,
we moight have won, but he drove his men
through the river loike a demon! Well, sir, I
was right in the thick of the carnage; I&#8217;d jist
cut a clane swathe through the Dutch Blues,
and I was daling death and desthruction on
ivery side, following in th&#8217; thrack of Sarsfield,
whin, all of a suddent, me shoes turned me
around and comminced to run. I was beside
meself with the shame of it, me lord. I cut at
those thongs with my sword an&#8217; I swore an&#8217;
called on the saints and the divils, but niver a
bit could I get those boots off, and away they
ran, loike the wind, splash through the mud
and the mire, and they niver sthopped until
we reached Dublin; but, my lord,&#8221; Denis
lowered his voice and winked one eye, &#8220;even
my shoes didn&#8217;t get there&mdash;before King
James!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas, no,&#8221; said his master sternly, &#8220;it was
a king we lacked,&#8221; and he rose and walked
twice across the room, his face darkly clouded.</p>

<p>His man watched him keenly, with an expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
of deep concern and simple affection,&mdash;the
humble devotion of a faithful dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will clean my sword and call me an
hour before sunrise, Denis,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I will
snatch some hours&#8217; rest, even if it happens to be
my turn to-morrow,&#8221; and he laughed as he began
to cast off his garments with his servant&#8217;s help.</p>

<p>Denis shook his head sadly. &#8220;Ah, me
Lord Clancarty,&#8221; he said with a break in his
voice, &#8220;&#8217;twould be a sad day fer me, and
you are so ready to die with a smile on your
lips. Ye were iver so, but ye&#8217;ll break a heart
some day, me lord, jist as recklessly&mdash;an&#8217; ye&#8217;ll
forgive me fer saying it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is not much that I would not forgive
you, old Denis,&#8221; said the young nobleman
kindly, &#8220;we&#8217;re old friends and tried. But
what have I to live for at best, unless it be the
headsman&#8217;s block? I am a proscribed and
penniless outlaw, Denis; if, by any chance,
I am recognized, I go to the Tower. I have
no friends here; not even my wife knows who
I am&mdash;and why should she? It seems but
folly to think of her, when I have only an
exile&#8217;s life to offer her&mdash;I am a fool, a
wretched fool!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indade, me lord, ye greatly misjudge a
woman av you think she&#8217;ll be afther counting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
yer money&mdash;or the costs ayther,&#8221; said Denis
quietly; &#8220;a woman niver thinks of it, bless
her heart, she jist falls in love, and thin to the
divil with prudence or wisdom ayther. And,
by the Virgin, me Lady Clancarty is none of
yer cowards. I&#8217;ve sane the spark in her eye,
me lord, and if it plazes her, she&#8217;ll fight yer
battles, sir, to the ind of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Clancarty smiled. &#8220;Exactly, Denis,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;but if I do not please her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Denis was on his knees, drawing off his
master&#8217;s shoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;d be a blind woman, thin, sir,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;and faix, I&#8217;ll wager me lady knows a
foine man whin she sees wan. But, pshaw, sir,
by to-morrow night ye may be stark and stiff
and ready for the churchyard,&#8221; and Denis
shook his head dolefully.</p>

<p>The earl laughed, throwing himself upon his
hard bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put out the taper, Denis,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll
hope for the best. If I can&#8217;t live for my lady,
at least I can die for her&mdash;with a light heart,&#8221;
and he turned his face to the wall with a laugh.</p>

<p>Denis wiped his eyes on his sleeve and
wagged his head again and again, his mind on
the morrow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">LADY BETTY TAKES THE FIELD</p>


<p class="drop-cap">THE sun had not yet risen: earth and
sky were softly gray and brown, with
green where the meadows lay, and
purple in the shadows. Morning, like a white
flower with a heart of gold, opened in the east.
Shafts of light&mdash;the sun&#8217;s gold-tipped arrows&mdash;quivered
on the distant hills, while the
vapors, smokelike and fantastic, floated along
the level lands and the trees loomed spectre-like.</p>

<p>It was chilly, too, with the chill of dawn in
the early autumn, and Lord Clancarty and
young Mackie were muffled in their cloaks as
they walked across the fields together. The
Irishman was smiling, in his usual daring
fashion, but the younger man was sober and
even nervous as he listened to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to thank you, Sir Edward,&#8221; Clancarty
said, &#8220;for standing by a stranger, but I
should look for no less at your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>&#8220;I am very glad to serve you, Mr. Trevor,&#8221;
the young man replied, blushing like a girl, &#8220;I
thought Lord Savile&#8217;s attitude toward you
quite unwarranted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We Irishmen do not look for courtesy at
the hands of our conquerors, except in a few
rare instances,&#8221; Clancarty said; &#8220;but it is due
to you, Sir Edward, to tell you that my name
is not Trevor; I assumed it for convenience
only; I am the proscribed exile, Donough
Macarthy of Clancarty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Mackie stopped short with a gasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Clancarty&#8217;s husband!&#8221; he cried,
turning deadly pale.</p>

<p>Lord Clancarty bowed. &#8220;The same,&#8221; he
said smiling, &#8220;and in telling you, I confide in
your honor not to reveal my identity&mdash;even
to Lady Clancarty, unless I fall, and then&mdash;I
would have her ladyship know that she was
free.&#8221;</p>

<p>But young Mackie had not yet recovered
his composure; he stared at the earl strangely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she not divine your identity?&#8221; he
asked, and the pain in his face was so easy to
read that Lady Clancarty&#8217;s husband smiled
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; he responded; &#8220;but we must
go on unless we would be tardy at keeping the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
tryst.&#8221; Then he glanced sharply at the boy,
&#8220;I take it for granted that you are willing to
stand by me; if not&mdash;I fully pardon you, Sir
Edward, and I can go alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Mackie&#8217;s face crimsoned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, my lord,&#8221; he said bluntly, &#8220;I did
not offer to stand by you for love, but for
honor&#8217;s sake, and now&mdash;I will&mdash;for her sake,&#8221;
and he raised his hat reverently.</p>

<p>Lord Clancarty bared his own head and
kissed the hilt of his sword.</p>

<p>&#8220;For her dear sake, sir,&#8221; he said; &#8220;so let
it be, I love you for it,&#8221; and they walked on
in silence.</p>

<p>They passed through the grove of limes
and entered the field. As they did so, the sunbeams,
sloping from the hills, fell on the tree
tops, but the long meadow was in the shadow.
The sweetness of new-mown hay was in the air;
there was a glint of white blossoming still upon
the hedgerow, and beyond, the red brown of
new turned earth and green, the green of the
turf and the hawthorn.</p>

<p>Across the meadow from the farther side
came Lord Savile and Mr. Benham, and as
the two parties approached they saluted
courteously. Clancarty was smiling, gracious,
perfectly at ease, but his opponent scowled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
sullenly; some instinct&mdash;a brute one doubtless&mdash;made
him hate this daring Irishman.
Sir Edward, full of boyish importance, beckoned
Mr. Benham aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we adjust this difference, sir?&#8221; he
asked; &#8220;there is a serious reason why they
should not fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benham stared at him coolly. &#8220;To be sure,
so I supposed,&#8221; he drawled indifferently; &#8220;but
Savile will give you twenty reasons why they
should.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For all that, we might adjust it honorably,&#8221;
urged Mackie, with feverish anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw, man, we can&#8217;t!&#8221; said Benham,
with contempt; &#8220;they&#8217;re both in love with the
same woman. You are inexperienced, sir,&#8221; he
added aloud, smiling scornfully. &#8220;Measure
the paces, Sir Edward; the sun is rising, and
the advantage will lie then with the man whose
back is toward it. We will draw lots, sir, so&mdash;ah,
Lord Savile has drawn the best position,&#8221;
and he laughed complacently.</p>

<p>Young Mackie, crimsoned with confusion
and annoyance, made no further effort at a
compromise; instead he busied himself with
the weapons and in helping Lord Clancarty
strip off coat and waistcoat. Then the two
men confronted each other, sword in hand, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
as they did so the sun looked over the horizon
and the meadow suddenly lay in a golden mist
as the sparks flew from the steel.</p>

<p>This was the picture that Betty saw floating
in a golden haze, two strong, lithe figures
swaying lightly from side to side and the flash
of their naked swords at play.</p>

<p>&#8220;For shame!&#8221; she cried, thrusting their
weapons aside with her own white hands, &#8220;for
shame! So, there is no better cause for a fight
than a song?&#8221;</p>

<p>At the sight of her the two men stepped
back in sheer amazement, sinking their sword
points in the ground at her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, shame on you both!&#8221; she cried with
sparkling eyes; &#8220;&#8217;tis but a pretty fashion of
murder&mdash;and I&#8217;ll none of it! Put up your
weapons, gentlemen, for he who draws his here
is my friend no more!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Savile&#8217;s sword leaped into its sheath,
but Clancarty kissed the hilt of his and handed
it to Lady Betty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam, my honor is involved,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and I place it in your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>The color rose in her cheeks and she turned
on Savile.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; she said wilfully, &#8220;I heard it
all, and &#8217;tis you who should ask pardon.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>Savile flushed darkly and folded his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lady,&#8221; he said, &#8220;my sword is at your
service, but you ask too much now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you will not trust me with your honor,
my lord,&#8221; she retorted, with a little laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; he replied testily, &#8220;a man may not
grovel to his foe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Lady Betty, and she glanced at
him archly, &#8220;is your reasoning quite sound,
my lord?&#8221;</p>

<p>Savile bit his lip; he saw Lord Clancarty
smile and brush a fallen leaf from his sleeve
with elaborate care.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come,&#8221; interposed Mr. Benham,
&#8220;let there be peace, since my lady wills it;
and here, too, is young Mackie pining to
mediate. My lord, we cannot quarrel before
a lady,&#8221; and he spoke a few words very low
in Savile&#8217;s ear.</p>

<p>Betty, meanwhile, stood between them,
holding Clancarty&#8217;s sword in her hand; her
tall young figure outlined in the heavenly
morning sunshine, and the glory of the day in
her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;To put up your sword is naught, my lord,
unless there be peace,&#8221; she said, smiling ingenuously,
&#8220;pshaw, what a petty quarrel! &#8217;Tis
like two women over a cup of tea or a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
gown,&#8221; and she shrugged her shoulders prettily.</p>

<p>Lord Savile crossed over to Clancarty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your hand, sir,&#8221; he said, and then, as he
clasped it, very low, &#8220;another time and another
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am always at your service,&#8221; replied
Clancarty with a scornful smile, and he took
out his handkerchief and wiped the palm of
his right hand.</p>

<p>The gesture made Lady Betty smile and bite
her lip, though she had not heard the undertone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith, the morning is so lovely that it
augurs a peaceful day,&#8221; she said, with her
sweetest manner. &#8220;Gentlemen, you are all
bidden to join my Lady Sunderland and me at
eleven for a cup of chocolate before we go to
the races.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who could refuse?&#8221; Mr. Benham said
gallantly; &#8220;when men make peace for your
sake, my lady, what would they not do?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Lady Betty&#8217;s quick eye caught the
gloom on the boyish face of young Mackie.
She held out her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Edward, you will take me home to the
inn?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>He colored like a girl and involuntarily
glanced at Lord Clancarty; then catching his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
lordship&#8217;s falcon eye, he bowed in deep confusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only too happy, my lady,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She stood quite still, her bright eyes on
Lord Savile and Mr. Benham. Then she
pointed with her finger toward the farther end
of the field.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yonder,&#8221; she said, &#8220;one combatant and his
friend retire, and,&#8221; she turned quickly, pointing
in the opposite direction, &#8220;yonder, the others
go!&#8221;</p>

<p>Clancarty laughed. &#8220;A safe device, my
lady,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I could not fight without
my sword.&#8221;</p>

<p>She blushed prettily and held it out to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I forgot, sir,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>He took it gracefully, kissing the hand that
gave it in spite of her quick frown of displeasure.</p>

<p>Lord Savile bowed profoundly, his hand on
his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam, I obey,&#8221; he said gallantly, and
retreated with Mr. Benham in the direction
she had chosen, and at the same time Lord
Clancarty went in the other, leaving Lady
Betty alone in the field with young Mackie.</p>

<p>Hovering in the distance was the muffled
figure of Alice, who had accompanied her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
mistress to the grove of limes and halted there,
with her fingers in her ears, lest she should
hear the clash of swords.</p>

<p>But Lady Betty saw her not, nor the glory of
the day, nor the green of hedgerows and fields,
nor the blooming daisy at her feet. Her eyes
followed the figure of Clancarty, and there was
a shadow on her face. She shivered and drew
her cloak about her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Sir Edward,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we must
run for it; I am a truant, and Lord Spencer
will put me upon bread and water if he finds me
upon such errands, and faith, sir, I deserve it!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">THE INN GARDEN</p>


<p class="drop-cap">BETWEEN two vases that overflowed
with scarlet geraniums, the worn stone
steps of the inn-yard descended directly
upon a gravel path in the old garden. The
path&mdash;flanked on either side by tall hedges&mdash;wound
completely around the garden and
through the centre, in a kind of true lovers&#8217;
knot, in the loops of which were all old-fashioned
flowers; pale tea roses&mdash;the last of
September&#8217;s bloom&mdash;and mignonette; pansies
and rosemary grew there, and the blue of larkspur.
Only a few windows looked out upon
it, and it was a secluded spot where the sun
shone and the pigeons flocked. So still was it,
in the farther corners, that there was scarcely a
sound but the soft &#8220;kourre, kourre!&#8221; of the
feathered visitors.</p>

<p>Here Lady Betty walked slowly, her hands
behind her, her head a little on one side, as she
talked to Clancarty, whom she still knew only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
as Richard Trevor. She was dressed in white,
a bunch of red flowers at her belt and red
plumes in her hat, and either its broad brim
or her mood cast a shadow in her eyes. They
were softer, more pensive, and less sparkling
than usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was only eleven years old, sir,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;a mere baby, and I have never seen Lord
Clancarty since. How should I know how
he looks? Is not my curiosity pardonable?
Pray, Mr. Trevor, describe him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her companion had been watching her
keenly and now he smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m poor at descriptions, my lady,&#8221; he
said calmly, &#8220;but take my word for it,
Clancarty&#8217;s a handsome man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About your height, sir?&#8221; asked Lady
Betty, casting a quizzical, sidelong glance at
him.</p>

<p>He took time to consider. &#8220;Very nearly,
I should think, Lady Clancarty,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and straight as an arrow&mdash;with a good head
and keen eyes, a fine nose, a firm chin&mdash;oh,
a very handsome rascal, madam, and quite
unworthy of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; said Betty, amused; &#8220;you take
the side, then, of my family; they too believe
him unworthy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>&#8220;He is unworthy, madam,&#8221; said the disguised
nobleman gravely, &#8220;he is unworthy;
but, in spite of that, I can&#8217;t advise you to
cast him off. But for his skill as a swordsman
I should have lost my life; I am therefore,
of necessity, his true vassal, Lady
Clancarty, and I must plead his cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Betty&#8217;s face changed and she made a
petulant gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one can plead it, sir,&#8221; she said sharply,
&#8220;he should plead it himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He should indeed, madam,&#8221; he said earnestly,
&#8220;but how? Many things keep back a
proscribed exile and a beggar. How can he
plead his cause with the heiress of an earl, a
beautiful and gifted and wealthy woman?
What can he offer her? A life of exile,
poverty, and obscurity? My Lady Clancarty,
any proud man might well pause.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Betty&#8217;s chin was elevated, her eyes
scornful.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pride is, of course, all on his side,
sir,&#8221; she said coolly; &#8220;there is naught to be
said for her. How, think you, does a woman
feel who is deserted by her husband? Ay,
more, who is unacknowledged by him&mdash;unclaimed!&#8221;</p>

<p>He started and looked at her earnestly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>&#8220;You are right, madam,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it is a
grievous fault. I despise my Lord Clancarty
for it, but I know that the day will come when
he will sue for your forgiveness with all his
heart. And he has never known you. He
has been in battles, in sieges, in exile, in
poverty, in illness, and he was but a lad when
you were wedded. My lady, I can say no
more, even for him; I would fain say it for
myself&mdash;but for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She flashed a startled, wondering look at
him; her heart stood still&mdash;after all, was he?
was he not? She did not know, but his eyes
held her; she blushed, palpitated, shrank like
a mere child. From the first, she had thought
this man her husband, but now&mdash;? An awful
doubt shook her soul. Could it be that he
was not? She put out her hands with a strange
gesture as though she would hold him off.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis fourteen years, sir,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
he has never written me one word&mdash;or to my
family for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not true,&#8221; he replied gravely; &#8220;I
know, from Lord Clancarty&#8217;s own lips, that he
has written to your father within a short time,
ay, madam, twice since the Peace of Ryswick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Lady Betty, for a light broke
in upon her, and she thought of the tall old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
man walking in the gallery at Althorpe,
&#8220;I never knew it,&#8221; she added quietly, &#8220;my
whole family opposes any mention of&mdash;of my
husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>She pronounced the word with a soft adorable
hesitation, blushing rosily up to her very
ears, and his eyes glowed as he looked at her.
They turned a loop of the gravel walk and
passed Melissa, who huddled against the hedge,
courtesying low. Betty scarcely glanced at
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there is no one to plead my friend&#8217;s
cause but your own heart, Lady Clancarty,&#8221; he
said quietly, &#8220;your own heart and the tie that
must plead for itself a little. I have no eloquence
to match the occasion, willingly as I
serve my benefactor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you plainly, sir,&#8221; she retorted, &#8220;that
I will hear only one suit, and that is from him;
nor will I, mark you, promise to hear that
favorably. Love, sir, is not cold and a laggard
and full of excuses. If I am worth having
I am worth winning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam, I am constrained to tell the truth,&#8221;
he said in a tone of deep emotion; &#8220;I believe
that Lord Clancarty would die to win you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Die, sir,&#8221; she said archly, &#8220;rather live.
Dead he could not win me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>&#8220;Ay, and &#8217;twould be the bitterness of death
to lose you,&#8221; he said; &#8220;&#8217;tis so&mdash;even to
think of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>The break in his words made her heart beat
fast, but she was mistress of herself now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Especially after fourteen years of absence,&#8221;
she mocked wickedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fourteen years in purgatory, madam,&#8221; he
replied, his tone full of pathos, of powerful
emotion under restraint; &#8220;and when the poor
exile sees at last the gates of paradise!&mdash;ah,
my lady, you will not close them in his face?&#8221;</p>

<p>She bowed her head a little, looking pensively
at the ground. A thousand emotions
swept across her charming face. Then she
looked up, her eyes dancing with mischief,&mdash;arch,
naughty, daring.</p>

<p>&#8220;A singular paradise for my Lord Clancarty,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;a paradise with a Whiggish
Protestant wife in it, and a Whiggish Protestant
mother-in-law, and the greatest Whig in
England for a brother-in-law. Sir, I need
enumerate no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Irishman laughed a little bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; he said, with daring tenderness
in his tone, &#8220;you know not what love is!
Who would count the cost&mdash;who loved? By
all the saints, my lady, love burns away both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
politics and creeds; death itself is beaten by
it&mdash;and hell! Ah, to teach you how to love.
&#8217;Twould be worth purgatory!&#8221; his gray eyes
flashed, his strong face set itself sternly.</p>

<p>Lady Betty looking at him drew her breath
hard; she was almost frightened. Here was a
nature she could not conquer and she could
not scorn. She bit her lip and looked steadily
away, her heart beating in her throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Lord Clancarty came here,&#8221; he said
after a moment, in a constrained voice, &#8220;would
you see him? would you listen to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated; she no longer believed that
this man might be her husband; he had succeeded
in misleading her, and her whole soul
was tossing and burning in the fire of a new and
passionate emotion, but she tried to think.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would see him, yes,&#8221; she said with white
lips, glancing defiantly at him, &#8220;he is my
husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes darkened and his face changed;
she could not read it. They had come back
to the old stone steps. At the top appeared
Lady Sunderland and Lady Dacres, too far off
as yet to be heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;He shall come, then, my lady,&#8221; he said
very low, looking straight into her eyes, &#8220;he
shall come&mdash;if he dies for it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>Lady Betty&#8217;s face was as white as her gown,
and her fingers trembled as she swept her skirts
aside on either hand and courtesied gracefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bid you adieu, sir,&#8221; she said, and walked
up the steps just as Lady Sunderland called
out sharply,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Betty, Betty, come and take tea with us,
my love, and teach Lady Dacres that old game
of &#8216;Angel Beast&#8217;; she hath forgotten it. La,
how white you are, my dear; a touch of rouge
and a patch&mdash;you look like a ghost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am, madam,&#8221; said Lady Betty.</p>

<p>And the two dames stared.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night the ruthless Lady Betty awakened
her attendant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alice,&#8221; she said, &#8220;hast ever heard the
legend of King Arthur?&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor handmaid yawned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, madam,&#8221; she replied sleepily, &#8220;who
was he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A king of long ago, Alice,&#8221; Lady Betty
explained, &#8220;I have heard the legend from my
old Welsh nurse, and part of it relates to his
wife, his queen. She was very beautiful, and
she had never seen the king when the marriage
was arranged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mercy on us, madam!&#8221; exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Alice, &#8220;and she didn&#8217;t know what he looked
like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; declared her mistress, &#8220;and
she set out with all her maidens to go to his
kingdom to be married&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, my lady, couldn&#8217;t he come for
her&mdash;like a decent civil gentleman?&#8221; asked
Alice rousing up.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, he couldn&#8217;t come,&#8221; said Lady
Clancarty, &#8220;but he sent his best friend, a
brave and noble knight, to meet her, and she&mdash;she
thought he was the king in disguise
and&mdash;and she fell in love with him, and when
she found out her mistake, and that the king
was wholly unlike this knight, she couldn&#8217;t love
her husband&mdash;she loved instead his friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My goodness, Lady Betty, how improper!&#8221;
said Alice horrified, &#8220;his friend was a false
man&mdash;and no true knight!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Betty had been sitting on the edge of
Alice&#8217;s bed but she rose now and stood quite
still, her white figure showing in the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Alice, she was so beautiful, so fascinating&mdash;he
couldn&#8217;t help it, he loved her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He could help it,&#8221; said Alice stoutly, &#8220;he
stole her love from her husband! He could
help it, just as a man can help stealing a
horse.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>Betty gave a little gasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the queen?&#8221; she said faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was a very wicked woman, madam,&#8221;
declared the moralist, shaking up her pillows
vigorously. &#8220;They do say that King Charles
had an awful court; perhaps it was the
fashion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it was,&#8221; admitted Lady Betty,
and crept softly back to bed and wept salt
tears in solitude.</p>

<p class="ph3">MY LADY SUNDERLAND TAKES TEA</p>


<p class="drop-cap">A SMOKING teapot and some cups of
India ware adorned a table of polished
mahogany, the very best tea service in
the possession of the landlord of the Lion&#8217;s
Head. And before it sat Lady Sunderland
and her intimate, Lady Dacres. Opposite,
Lady Betty was stirring a cup of chocolate.
There was a little black patch on her white
forehead and another on the tip of her rosy
chin, and her gown of gold-colored paduasoy
became her well.</p>

<p>A servant brought in a tray with some
glasses and a bottle of usquebaugh, and served
the elder dames, who had been pretending to
sip tea. The two worthies were just from the
cockpit and had won forty pounds between
them. Lady Sunderland, in a flowered brocade,
with a painted and patched face, could do
nothing but simper, and even old Lady Dacres
grinned placidly, while the younger countess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
watched them from under her dark lashes and
made no comments.</p>

<p>&#8220;La, Betty, there never was such an obliging
man as young Savile,&#8221; said Lady Sunderland,
sipping her usquebaugh; &#8220;he ran about at the
cockpit to wait upon us, and his wit&mdash;take
my word for it, we&#8217;d have lost fifty pounds
but for his judgment of the birds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he knows whose mamma to wait
upon!&#8221; said Lady Dacres, with a sly wink at
her friend; &#8220;how sweet the young fellows are
to the mother of such a daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Sunderland tittered. &#8220;There was a
time when I thought it was the mamma and
not the daughter,&#8221; she said, with a simper;
&#8220;but now it&#8217;s, &#8216;How&#8217;s Lady Clancarty?&#8217; and
&#8216;Where&#8217;s your ladyship&#8217;s daughter?&#8217; and
&#8216;My compliments to the fair Lady Elizabeth.&#8217;
La, how the beaux smirk and bow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now&#8217;s your chance, Betty, dear,&#8221; said
Lady Dacres; &#8220;don&#8217;t make &#8217;em dance too
long, my girl, we can&#8217;t be young but once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty gave her a cold stare. &#8220;I&#8217;m already
married, madam,&#8221; she said, and pushed the
bottle nearer to the elbow of the old peeress;
&#8220;take another drop, my lady, &#8217;twill sustain
you under the blow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Sunderland set down her glass and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
fixed her daughter with an irate eye, but before
she could give voice to her wrath they were
interrupted by the entrance of Lord Spencer.
He came in with an air of cool elegance, faultlessly
attired, and bowing gracefully to the
three women, kissed his mother&#8217;s hand, and
took his place with his back to the window,
overlooking them with an air of superiority
that was peculiarly exasperating to his high-spirited
sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;La, my dear, what a happy woman you
are,&#8221; Lady Dacres said, in an audible aside to
Lady Sunderland, &#8220;to be the mother of two
such beautiful children. &#8217;Pon my soul, Spencer
would have broken my heart at eighteen!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, you would have broken mine,
madam,&#8221; Lord Spencer replied gracefully.</p>

<p>She giggled and took another draught
of usquebaugh, following Lady Clancarty&#8217;s
suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us the news, Spencer,&#8221; said Lady
Betty impatiently, with a contemptuous glance
at the old woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;The king is better,&#8221; said her brother, with
a drawl, &#8220;and the Princess of Denmark did
not go out to-day because of a quarrel with
Lady Marlborough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor soul, she&#8217;s little better than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
slave,&#8221; remarked Betty scornfully; &#8220;is that
all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; the news of the day is the duel. It
has just come out that Sir Thomas Compton
shot and killed his brother-in-law last
Tuesday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Sunderland gave a little scream of
surprise. &#8220;What? Shot Lord Fraunces?&#8221;</p>

<p>Spencer nodded gloomily.</p>

<p>&#8220;And wherefore?&#8221; demanded his sister.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he was a traitor,&#8221; he said coolly;
&#8220;he kept his horse saddled in his stable ready
for flight, and two grooms at his beck; this
made Compton suspect him. So he went
down to Deptford, on pretence of seeing his
sister, and he found the fellow was in league
with the French party and&mdash;There was a
quarrel and he shot him. There&#8217;s an article
about it in the <i>Post-Boy</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The cold-hearted brute!&#8221; cried Betty;
&#8220;his poor sister loved her husband dearly.
Where is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mad as Bedlam,&#8221; replied her brother
coolly; &#8220;a man must do his duty, even if it
kills his sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose so,&#8221; said Lady Betty, rising,
&#8220;he must stab her to the heart and glory in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
it&mdash;for his party,&#8221; she added mockingly; &#8220;a
fine spirit, sir, I admire it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; he replied pompously, staring
at her with hard eyes; &#8220;a man must do his
duty, like a Spartan, to his king, his conscience,
and his party. There are examples
enough in the history of Greece and of Rome,
lofty&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; cried Lady Betty vigorously,
&#8220;to the wind with your examples. Give me
a noble heart, a Christian life, a brotherly love,
a willingness to live and die for high purposes.
Poor Lady Fraunces!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, never you mind, my dear,&#8221; put in old
Lady Dacres, with a titter, &#8220;she&#8217;ll get over it.
Grief doesn&#8217;t kill; her mother had three husbands
and&mdash;&#8221; she whispered a scandal behind
her fan to Lady Sunderland, who was so overcome
with her wit that she rocked with laughter,
wiping the tears from her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your sympathy is quite absurd,&#8221; said
Spencer, looking straight into Betty&#8217;s eyes.
&#8220;Sir Thomas did his duty. I would have
sent a traitor brother-in-law to the block,
madam, quite as cheerfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your sister also, I presume,&#8221; she
replied, courtesying profoundly; &#8220;from my
heart I thank you, my lord.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, la, Betty, drink your chocolate and
don&#8217;t be a fool,&#8221; said her mother petulantly.</p>

<p>Betty smiled sweetly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I have quite
finished it. I will send some more to my
Lord Spencer,&#8221; and she walked out of the
room with her head in the air.</p>

<p>Half way across the hall she met a servant,
the Irishman Denis. He stopped her with a
bow, one hand on his heart and an air of great
secrecy and gallantry, and he handed her a
letter. She took it as silently, and when she
reached her own door she hid it in her bosom
for she knew that Alice Lynn was there. The
girl had been folding up her ladyship&#8217;s finery
and looked up at her entrance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything is ready now, my lady,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;and if it pleases you, I will go into town
a little way to buy that ribbon for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Alice,&#8221; Betty assented with alacrity,
&#8220;and here is the money; and stop, too, at
the haberdasher&#8217;s and buy some more of that
silk; and here, my girl, get some pink ribbon
for that Sunday frock of yours, I will
have you look your best.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice courtesied and thanked her, blushing
with pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are so dear a mistress to me, madam,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
she said tenderly, &#8220;I am not half worthy
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Clancarty patted her cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you love me, Alice?&#8221; she asked
pensively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dearly, madam,&#8221; said the girl, simply,
&#8220;and I would serve you&mdash;as my family served
yours&mdash;faithfully forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Betty sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may need it,&#8221; she said, and busied herself
examining some lace and ribbons that
Alice had just laid aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust you may need nothing but my love
and service, madam,&#8221; Alice said; &#8220;may happiness
and love and honor ever attend my dear,
dear lady,&#8221; and she went on talking cheerfully
of the fair day, the sunshine, and the gay scene
without, for she saw a shadow on the countess&#8217;
face and it troubled her loyal heart.</p>

<p>But Lady Clancarty said not a word. Instead,
her eyes avoided the girl&#8217;s honest glance;
she blushed and paled like a guilty thing, but
an adorable smile trembled on her lips. Not
until Alice went out, closing the door behind
her, did Betty move. Then she shot the
bolts and drew forth the paper from her bosom;
she looked over her shoulder, smiled, carried
it half way to her face, started, and held it off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
again, opening it, at last, under the window.
The sheet was closely covered with writing
and she read it eagerly, and her hands quivered
so that the paper shook, and she fell on
her knees beside the window and leaning her
arms upon the sill, buried her face upon them.
She knelt there a long time, the sunlight
touching her hair and the beautiful curves of
her shoulders. After a while she rose, and
going slowly to the mirror stood looking at
herself, the crumpled paper in her hand. Her
face was white as snow but beautiful, with quite
a new and tender beauty. She scarcely knew
herself, even when she smiled, nodding at her
own reflection.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis he!&#8221; Lady Betty murmured to the
mirror, laughing softly, &#8220;&#8217;tis he! Oh, my
prophetic heart&mdash;I knew it!&#8221;</p>

<p class="ph3">MY LORD CLANCARTY</p>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE was a ball that night at Newmarket,
but Lady Clancarty did not
go, in spite of the commands and entreaties
of Lady Sunderland. The elder countess
was particularly anxious to display her
handsome daughter at the assembly, and nothing
could exceed her anger and chagrin at the
younger woman&#8217;s obstinacy. By afternoon the
quarrel waxed so hot that Betty pleaded illness
and went to bed, as a last resort, and stayed
there, too, in spite of her mother&#8217;s rage. Lady
Sunderland, who in a passion could forget
herself and use such language as only a fish-wife
or a woman of fashion could command,
heaped recriminations on her daughter, and
screamed and chattered and swore a little, too,
for my lady was a pupil&mdash;and an apt one&mdash;of
the court of Charles the Second. But Lady
Betty was more than her match in wit and
strength of will, and she won the victory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
When the hour for the ball arrived, her mother
had to go with Lord Spencer and leave her
daughter calmly ensconced in bed, defiant and
triumphant. The Countess of Sunderland&#8217;s
chair was brought to the inn door, preceded
by the link-boys with their lanthorns, and the
lady was helped into it by her son, her very
headdress quivering with rage and the color of
the paint upon her cheeks enhanced by the
flush of anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;The minx!&#8221; she exclaimed to Spencer,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe she&#8217;s ill at all; it&#8217;s nothing
but her obstinacy and some fancy she has about
that scapegrace, Clancarty. The saucy little
baggage defied me, and looked as lovely as any
nymph all the time! Your father must see to
it&mdash;there must be a divorce from that creature,
or next thing, she&#8217;ll run away to France with
him; she&#8217;s equal to it, the little wretch!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never, madam,&#8221; said Spencer solemnly,
&#8220;I&#8217;d see her dead first&mdash;before she disgraced
the family!&#8221;</p>

<p>If the truth be told, this was too much for
the countess; she gasped and stared uneasily
at this self-righteous young man, who certainly
resembled her as little as he did the versatile
and unprincipled Sunderland.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the invalid at the Lion&#8217;s Head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
had miraculously recovered and dressed herself
with the assistance of Alice, who viewed the
whole proceeding with amazement and distinct
disapproval. She knew that Lady Clancarty
had not been ill and she looked upon the stratagem
as an unworthy deceit. Her mistress,
reading her as easily as an open book, understood
the girl&#8217;s mood and said nothing to her.
Instead, she set her the task of lighting the
candles in the room where she received her
guests, and seeing that the servant replenished
the wood fire and drew the curtains. Finally
she came in herself, a charming figure in pink,
with a single rose in her hair. Finding everything
arranged to her satisfaction, she dismissed
her attendant and waited quite alone, standing
before the hearth and gazing pensively at the
fire. Though she was outwardly calm, a storm
was raging in her bosom. He had asked for
this interview and he was coming, and now she
shrank from the thought of this meeting with
sudden trepidation. She bit her lip and stared
into the fire, but her hands quivered and her
heart beat almost to suffocation. She had
thought of this moment many, many times&mdash;girlish
day-dreams of her lover and husband
coming to claim her&mdash;but she had never pictured
anything like this. A proscribed rebel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
who was forced to see her secretly, and the
man himself&mdash;ah, that was it! Here was a
powerful personality that she had never imagined;
there was something in his eyes, his
voice that drew her to him with so strange a
fascination that it frightened her. She knew
just how he would look, just the flash in his
gray eyes, the deep tones of his voice, before
she saw him enter. She struggled with herself
when she heard his tread in the hall and knew
it&mdash;and she was listening with strained ears,
when the door was opened for him. But
Lady Betty was not one to show the white
feather; she drew her breath hard and straightened
herself, and then she opened that fan of
hers&mdash;a beautiful affair from one of the India
houses in London&mdash;and she swayed it to and
fro shading her face.</p>

<p>Lord Clancarty came into the room with a
springing step, his face flushed and his eyes
shining; he wore, indeed, the air of a conquering
hero. But, almost at the threshold, he
halted and stood gazing at Betty in amazement.
She was still standing before the fire,
slowly wielding the fan, her face averted, pale,
cold, her chin up. Nothing could have been
more frozen than her attitude; it chilled even
his ardor, and he stood, with his hat in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
hand, and for a few moments there was silence.
Then Lady Betty broke it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I received your note, my lord,&#8221; she said,
in an icy tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil you did, madam,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I
should think that I had sent you a cartel&mdash;from
your manner of receiving me! Faith,
my lady, you seem marvellous glad to see
your husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>A shadow of a smile flickered in Betty&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;A welcome kept too long grows cold, sir,&#8221;
she replied.</p>

<p>He took a step toward her, tossing his hat
upon the table, and something in his face made
her back closer to the fire; he saw it and
stopped, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not believe in me,&#8221; he said reproachfully;
&#8220;I would have wooed you and
won you, dear, but for the cruelty of fate. I
am your husband,&#8221; he added softly; &#8220;does not
that plead a little?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A childish contract, a mere formal mockery,&#8221;
replied Lady Betty, cool as ice, looking
at him across the candles, &#8220;I should not dream
of being bound by it&mdash;no generous man would
base any claim upon it, sir;&#8221; she told this falsehood
glibly, though her very soul shook under
his glance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>The blood rushed up to his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I based any claim upon it, madam?&#8221;
he asked proudly.</p>

<p>This blow went home; her ladyship turned
crimson and bit her lips in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, you do not know me,&#8221; he said, and
his rich Irish voice deepened and softened
with restrained emotion; &#8220;I would scorn to
base any claim upon a tie not freely made&mdash;for
you were a child&mdash;but I thought,&#8221; he
paused, searching her face keenly, &#8220;I thought
your husband might win your heart, my lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave him a quick look, and then her
eyes avoided his and she struggled hard for
self-mastery. If he had known it then&mdash;one
word more, one step farther&mdash;but he waited
for her reply, and the wayward mood came
back upon her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fourteen years, my lord,&#8221; she said, shrugging
her shoulders, &#8220;and then, you plead your
title to my&mdash;my affections!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fourteen years,&#8221; he repeated slowly, &#8220;fourteen
years less of paradise, Betty, is not that
enough punishment for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She averted her face and did not reply.
He came a step nearer and she felt his hand
closing over hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you have come but for the Peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
of Ryswick?&#8221; she asked, looking up into
his eyes.</p>

<p>He smiled. &#8220;If we had won before,&#8221; he
replied, &#8220;if we had only won&mdash;I would have
come, a victor, to claim you. Betty, I did not
know you, I had never pictured you as you
are! I went to Althorpe like a thief in disguise,
to see you, and from that moment in the
greenwood, I loved you&mdash;I love you madly
now!&#8221; he whispered, and she felt his breath
warm on her cheek.</p>

<p>She did not dare to look at him now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love you,&#8221; he said softly, &#8220;and&mdash;does
my wife care nothing for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Before she realized it he had his arm around
her, his lips almost touched hers. Then she
broke away from him, her eyes flashing, her
face on fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go too far, sir,&#8221; she cried angrily,
&#8220;you say you base no claim upon our relation,
and then&mdash;and then&mdash;&#8221; she stopped,
her breast heaving, tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>He smiled. &#8220;And then? I would have
kissed you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;by Saint Patrick, I
would give a kingdom&mdash;if it were mine&mdash;to
kiss you, but I will not force you to it, Lady
Clancarty!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You dare not!&#8221; she flashed at him angrily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>His eyes blazed. &#8220;I dare not?&#8221; he repeated,
&#8220;forsooth, madam, that is an ill word
to use to Donough Macarthy; I dare&mdash;anything!
But I want no woman against her
will. I wouldn&#8217;t give that, madam,&#8221; he snapped
his fingers, &#8220;not that&mdash;for you without your
heart!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, but the expression
of his face, his masterful manner, stung
her pride and angered her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a proscribed traitor, my lord,&#8221;
she said angrily, &#8220;how can you ask me to
share your life?&#8221;</p>

<p>His look withered her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I ask for your love.
No loving woman ever thought of valuing her
husband by his misfortunes. I am a beggar
and an exile, my lady, and I have done wrong
to sue for your heart. I see that&mdash;like your
father&mdash;you value men by their positions in
the world!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face was crimson. &#8220;You insult me,
my lord!&#8221; she cried passionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you not insult me?&#8221; he asked bitterly;
&#8220;do you not infer that I only ask you
because I am broken in fortune and name&mdash;a
bankrupt? But look you, my lady, I cringe
at no rich man&#8217;s door for his daughter!&#8221; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
paused, and his red-hot anger suddenly turned
to ashes; his eyes dwelt on her with an affection
that moved her deeply; &#8220;I love you,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;I would have sued for your heart on
my knees&mdash;but, madam, I will take scorn
from no one&mdash;not even from you. In exile,
in illness, in suffering, I have often thought of
you&mdash;your face shone like a star upon me,
your pictured face, Betty, and when I saw you,
ah,&#8221; he paused, looking into the fire, &#8220;I love
you still&mdash;but you are Lord Sunderland&#8217;s
daughter. He has scorned the ruined Irishman,
and you&mdash;you scorn me too, it seems. Farewell,
my lady, you are my wife&mdash;but henceforth
I seek you no more. If you love me,
&#8217;twill be for you to tell the exile, the proscribed
traitor, so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty threw out her hands wildly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wrong me, sir,&#8221; she protested faintly;
&#8220;I did not mean to reproach you with poverty;
I&mdash;I spoke in anger.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he stood like a statue.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not love me,&#8221; he said, his deep
voice quivering, &#8220;and mark you, Lady Clancarty,
I will have nothing but your love&mdash;your
love; I shall take no less! I love you, you
are my very own, my wife,&#8221; his tone was
masterful, &#8220;but I, who love you, I will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
sue for your heart. I am too poor, madam, I
will not ask you to share an exile&#8217;s lot, you are
too great a lady,&#8221; he took his hat from the
table and bowed profoundly.</p>

<p>He longed to catch her in his arms and kiss
her, but he was too proud; he bowed and she
courtesied low, and in the dim light of the
candles he could not see the pallor of her face,
he could not hear her heart beat. Pride met
pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bid you farewell, my lady,&#8221; he said, and
bowed himself out of the room.</p>

<p>And Betty fell upon her knees beside the
table and laid her proud head down upon it
and wept as though her heart would break.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she sobbed to herself, &#8220;I am a beast,
a heartless little beast,&#8221; and then she wept
again, this being the manner of women.</p>

<p>And she did not see the door of Lady
Sunderland&#8217;s room open noiselessly, upon a
tiny crack, stay so a moment, and then close
again as silently. She neither saw nor heard
it in the passion of her grief.</p>

<p class="ph3">AT THE TOY-SHOP</p>


<p class="drop-cap">THE star of Lady Clancarty&#8217;s fortune
for that week at Newmarket was an
evil star. For it was the very day
after that fateful interview with her husband, a
day that dawned after a night of repentance
and good resolutions, that another straw turned
the tide against reconciliation. Lady Sunderland&#8217;s
party had spent the forenoon at the
theatre, and on their way to the race-course
they stopped at Master Drake&#8217;s toy-shop on
the promenade; a shop famous not only for
the toys and trinkets of a kind that amused the
women of fashion, but for the tea that he served
in a little room in the rear, which was divided
into stalls like those in coffee-rooms. Here
both beaux and belles congregated to sip tea,
and gossip, and raffle for some choice toy from
India.</p>

<p>The shop, recently replenished by its wily
proprietor, was a glittering mass of novelties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
and almost vied with the famous India houses
of London in its collection of Oriental articles.
Here were hideous dragons of porcelain, snuff-boxes
with jewelled lids, and canes of the latest
fashion, jars of snuff and pulvillo, and bottles
of rare perfumes, gilded flasks of cut glass,
boxes of patches ready cut for the cheeks and
brows of the beauties, ivory combs and fans of
wonderful and beautiful design, delicate tea-sets
and many bits of Dutch china, first accepted
because of the example of Queen Mary, gloves
and laces and even India shawls. Here, too,
were toys, jewelry, cogged dice, masks, dominoes
and vizors, and here, as in London, the
discreet toy-men handed <i>billets-doux</i> back and
forth and made appointments between the
beaux and belles; and here many a meeting
took place, and many a momentous question
was settled for all time, either in the toy-shop
itself or in the stalls behind it, where the world
of fashion reigned.</p>

<p>My Lady Sunderland and my Lady Dacres
were no sooner there than they were plunged in
the excitement of a raffle for a hideous china
dragon, and almost came to blows for the possession
of the treasure. But Lady Betty, quite
indifferent, stood apart talking to a group of
gay young people near the entrance. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Lord of Devonshire was there, and the Marquis
of Hartington, and in their train, young Mackie,
upon whom the Countess of Clancarty smiled;
and there, too, was Lord Savile, who had been
at her elbow all the morning and would have
declared his passion for her had he dared.
And she was in a reckless mood; her eyes
sparkled, her cheeks glowed, and she laughed
and jested, though her heart ached.</p>

<p>The king was well enough to be present at
the race in the afternoon and all the world was
agog to see him. The throng at the toy-shop
grew greater as the people stopped on their
way from the theatre to the track, and the
group at the door grew larger with Lady Betty
in the centre of it, sparkling and flushing and
laughing, the picture of a beautiful coquette.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the great men go up to Parliament
next Wednesday, Lady Clancarty,&#8221; said Mr.
Benham, &#8220;and we shall see your brother shine
as the bright particular star of the Whig firmament.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A star&mdash;a constellation rather; the Little
Bear of the party,&#8221; laughed Lady Betty roguishly;
&#8220;what will you do this season, my
Lord of Devonshire?&#8221;</p>

<p>The great man smiled benevolently upon the
beauty.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>&#8220;Whatever your heart desires, madam,&#8221; he
replied gallantly.</p>

<p>Betty flashed a quick look at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you indeed, my lord?&#8221; she asked
archly; &#8220;what if I should ask a great boon&mdash;even
half thy kingdom?&#8221;</p>

<p>Devonshire looked at the beautiful, flushed
face and marvelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even that, dear Lady Betty,&#8221; he replied
courteously, &#8220;even that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have your word, my lord,&#8221; she said, and
laughed softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And mine,&#8221; murmured Savile, in her ear,
&#8220;you have not asked&mdash;but it is the whole of
my kingdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; she said, and gave him a roguish
glance, &#8220;I do remember&mdash;but not your entire
trust in my decision!&#8221;</p>

<p>He blushed crimson. &#8220;I upheld my honor
then,&#8221; he murmured, looking into her eyes;
&#8220;my heart is yours&mdash;to break at will!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her expression changed, changed so sharply
that he looked around, following the direction
of her glance, and saw the face of the man he
hated&mdash;the Irish Jacobite. Lord Clancarty
stood just within the door, his eyes holding
Betty&#8217;s against her will. Savile heard her
quick gasp, saw her hands flutter, and he thrust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
himself between with a black look at Clancarty.
But Lady Betty, trying to collect herself, met
young Mackie&#8217;s eyes and saw that he knew.
The blood rushed to her temples but she
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; she said to Devonshire, &#8220;does
your horse run to-day? or my Lord Savile&#8217;s
gray mare?&#8221;</p>

<p>Devonshire smiled. &#8220;Both, my lady,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;and Savile will be a bankrupt before
night&mdash;in all but love, I suspect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A poor substitute for a full purse, my
lord,&#8221; she said recklessly, without taking
thought of her words until she felt rather than
saw Clancarty&#8217;s grave look at her. &#8220;I mean,&#8221;
she stammered, &#8220;in my Lord Savile&#8217;s case&mdash;&#8221;
and then she stopped, covered with confusion.</p>

<p>Never had Lady Betty made so many mistakes,
but young Mackie came valiantly to her
aid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you heard the rumor that the King
of Spain is dying?&#8221; he asked innocently.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has been dying for a long time,&#8221; remarked
Mr. Benham laughing, &#8220;and the King
of France and the emperor are dying of
anxiety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely, and but for our king there would
be a war for the succession within a week,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
said Devonshire thoughtfully; &#8220;as it is, the
peace of Europe hangs by a thread&mdash;the narrow
thread of a sickly man&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; put in Betty, herself again, &#8220;and
Parliament is for cutting down the military
establishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Devonshire smiled. &#8220;The people do not
love a standing army, Lady Clancarty,&#8221; he
replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she responded quickly, &#8220;they would
perhaps prefer a French fleet in the Thames.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of &#8217;em would,&#8221; said Savile sullenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, you are wrong,&#8221; declared Devonshire,
&#8220;no Englishman would&mdash;not even a
Jacobite&mdash;when it came to that. You remember
how the southern counties rose to
repulse Tourville&#8217;s squadron in &#8217;90?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are in the right, my lord; no true
Briton has ever thought of seeing his country
under the heel of Louis,&#8221; said Clancarty, suddenly
taking part in the conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some traitors&mdash;who are not Englishmen&mdash;would,
Mr. Trevor,&#8221; sneered Savile, with
an emphasis on the name.</p>

<p>The disguised earl shot a fierce glance at him
and smiled dangerously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little dogs snarl when they dare not bite,
my lord,&#8221; he said suavely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>&#8220;Since the famous peace, sir, all the renegades
and cutpurses talk loud,&#8221; replied Savile,
in an insolent undertone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cowards always insult men in the presence
of women,&#8221; retorted Clancarty smiling.</p>

<p>At this moment they were interrupted by a
movement of the throng, some passing out,
and my Lady Sunderland, having won her
Chinese dragon from all competitors, bore
down upon them flushed with triumph, and
the chairs were called.</p>

<p>Betty stood a moment at the threshold.
Clancarty was beside her, his face quite grave.
She looked up; the impulse was in her heart
to speak and their eyes met but his were cold.</p>

<p>&#8220;You choose wisely, my lady,&#8221; he said, in a
bitter undertone, &#8220;a full purse is better than a
beggarly love, it seems.&#8221;</p>

<p>She flushed crimson.</p>

<p>Savile thrust himself forward and held out
his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit me to put you in your chair, my
lady,&#8221; he said, grace and courtesy personified;
handsome, well dressed, courtly, the very
picture of a deferential lover.</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand thanks, my lord,&#8221; she said
sweetly, putting her hand in his.</p>

<p>He put her in her chair and the procession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
started, Lady Sunderland screaming to the
toy-man about the careful packing of her
dragon, and Betty looked out smiling, more
charming than ever.</p>

<p>A moment afterwards, Clancarty and Savile
faced each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;This very evening would be propitious,
my lord,&#8221; said the Irishman coolly, &#8220;the same
spot, I believe, and the same seconds?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At your service, sir,&#8221; said Savile fiercely,
&#8220;and damn you, I mean to kill you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m beholden to you, my lord,&#8221; replied
the earl, and laughed as he walked away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Betty,&#8221; he said to himself, as he
passed on toward the Lion&#8217;s Head, &#8220;is a
coquette worth dying for?&#8221; and then, after a
moment, he hummed two lines of the old
song:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ph3">THE DUEL</p>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;DENIS,&#8221; said Lord Clancarty laughing,
&#8220;in five minutes they will be
here and in ten I may be dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Divil a bit, my lord,&#8221; said Denis hopefully,
&#8220;unless you are kilt intirely.&#8221;</p>

<p>But there was a strange look in the faithful
Irishman&#8217;s eyes, a look of mute suffering.
Lord Clancarty slipped a ring off his finger
and gave it to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Denis,&#8221; he said, in an even voice, quiet
and cheerful, &#8220;if I fall, take that to Lady Clancarty
and tell her that she is free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my lord,&#8221; replied Denis, in a dull
tone, not looking up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even if I do not fall, you will take it to
her with that message,&#8221; continued the earl,
looking across the meadow at the approaching
figures of his opponent and their seconds and,
perhaps, his thoughts dwelt on that morning
when Lady Betty put the swords aside. &#8220;We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
will leave here to-morrow, Denis, or&mdash;&#8221; he
shrugged his shoulders, &#8220;there is little money
left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Faix, we&#8217;ll have to see th&#8217; Jews again, me
lord,&#8221; said the man dolefully; &#8220;they&#8217;re afther
bein&#8217; me most familiar friends, the jewels!&#8221;</p>

<p>Clancarty laughed.</p>

<p>A moment later he was bowing with ceremonious
courtesy to Lord Savile and Mr.
Benham. Young Mackie came up, too, bringing
a fourth person.</p>

<p>&#8220;I brought a surgeon, gentlemen,&#8221; he said
half apologetically; &#8220;Dr. Radcliffe, my Lord
Savile and&mdash;Mr. Trevor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Radcliffe, a large man wearing a rich but
old-fashioned dress and a huge periwig, bowed
gravely. He had a large practice and was
famous for a freedom of speech that had once
gone so far as to offend King William.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to thank you, gentlemen, for furnishing
me with patients,&#8221; he remarked dryly;
&#8220;let me beg you not to be too thorough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis to be to the finish, doctor,&#8221; said
Clancarty coolly, that dangerous smile on his
lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;A devilish poor plan,&#8221; said the doctor,
with a shrug; &#8220;it will take more than my skill
to resuscitate a corpse.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>&#8220;We shall not expect a miracle&mdash;even from
the great Dr. Radcliffe,&#8221; replied Clancarty.</p>

<p>Mr. Benham and young Mackie were
measuring the ground. Denis, in the meantime,
turned his face away and looked toward
the setting sun; it may be that he was wishing
for the shoes he wore at Boyne, but it is
not recorded. The clouds overhead were red
and the level meadows bathed in the slanting
rays of light; long shadows fell across the
scene; a bird sang in the grove of limes.</p>

<p>The two men stepped into the open, stripped
of coats and waistcoats, their white shirts showing
vividly against the green background.
Lord Savile was flushed, but Clancarty&#8217;s face
was singularly serene. The signal was given;
their weapons flashed, and there was the sudden
ring of steel on steel.</p>

<p>Ah, &#8217;twas a wonderful duel; afterwards,
men spoke of it as a kind of triumph in the
art of duelling, and Dr. Radcliffe described it
to the Princess Anne and the Duke of Marlborough.
Clancarty was an Irishman and
therefore a born fighter, though the Englishmen
of that day thought all Irishmen cowards
because the poor, barefoot peasants ran before
the trained battalions of the English and
Dutch. Moreover, the young earl had served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
a long apprenticeship on the Continent; and
in France duelling was the breath of men&#8217;s
nostrils. Clancarty fought that day recklessly
and beautifully; he was lithe and graceful as a
panther, with a wrist like steel and an eye that
never faltered, and he had met no mean antagonist;
my Lord Savile was counted one of the
best swordsmen in the Guards, and hating his
opponent he fought with fury.</p>

<p>Steel ground on steel and the sparks flew,
thrust and parry, point and blade, stroke on
stroke. The others watched in breathless admiration;
they even forgot their individual interest
in the struggle and stood gaping like
schoolboys. Both men were tired, yet both
played on, evenly matched, relentless and
reckless. There was a sudden thrust over
Savile&#8217;s guard and then, in an instant, Lord
Clancarty&#8217;s sword snapped at the hilt, just as
Savile&#8217;s crossed it and passed into his breast.
It was over in a moment, and he lay full length
on the turf and the blood was flowing from a
cut in his antagonist&#8217;s neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my lord, my own dear lord!&#8221; wailed
Denis, falling on his knees, and even Lord
Savile&#8217;s face was white as chalk.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the dimly lighted hall of the inn that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
night, Denis, with a lined, drawn face, white as
a dead man&#8217;s, laid something in Lady Betty&#8217;s
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me lord&#8217;s greetings to me lady,&#8221; he said
in a strained voice; &#8220;I was to give ye that
an&#8217; say, &#8216;Ye are quite free&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Betty stared at him wildly. She read
a message of calamity in his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it? What has happened?&#8221; she
cried.</p>

<p>But the Irishman only gave her one look of
deep reproach and plunged down the stairs into
the hubbub of the court.</p>

<p>Clancarty&#8217;s ring and &#8220;you are free&#8221;!</p>

<p>She swayed so that Alice Lynn, who came
running toward her, caught her in her arms and
almost carried her to her room.</p>

<p class="ph3">MY LORD SAVILE REAPS HIS REWARD</p>


<p class="drop-cap2">LADY SUNDERLAND was, as usual,
playing cards with her crony. The
game was gleek, and Lady Dacres
was determined to be avenged for the loss of
the Chinese dragon&mdash;grinning hideously
from the mantel&mdash;and she was betting and
cheating desperately. Dr. Radcliffe made a
third, and Lord Spencer looked on&mdash;politely
bored.</p>

<p>The tapers burned brightly and Lady Sunderland
simpered and nodded her head at Dr.
Radcliffe, though she would not have tolerated
his society if he had not been physician to the
Princess Anne and she hoped to extract some
royal gossip from him.</p>

<p>The host of the Lion&#8217;s Head came in himself,
with a servant bearing a large loving-cup
of silver. The good man was flushed and
obsequious and plainly out of sorts, keeping a
weather eye on Lord Spencer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>&#8220;Will your ladyship be pleased to try this
hypocras?&#8221; he said, bowing low; &#8220;&#8217;tis of my
own brewing and I&#8217;ll warrant it the finest in
the county&mdash;I had the rule from the keeper
of Man&#8217;s,&#8221; and he rubbed his fat hands together
unctuously.</p>

<p>Lady Dacres tasted first and rolled her eyes
up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ambrosia!&#8221; she said, &#8220;oh, la&mdash;I mean
nectar, don&#8217;t I, Lord Spencer?&#8221; and she
tittered like a girl of sixteen.</p>

<p>Dr. Radcliffe drank some deliberately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better than the brandy you sent us this
afternoon,&#8221; he remarked, with a twinkle in
his eye.</p>

<p>The man grew crimson. &#8220;&#8217;Tis for a better
purpose,&#8221; he stammered.</p>

<p>The great physician raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chut! that&#8217;s a strange notion,&#8221; he said
bluntly; &#8220;it is not a good purpose, then, to
save life?&#8221;</p>

<p>The innkeeper worked his hands nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard strange things since, your
worship,&#8221; he faltered, his eye on the young
nobleman.</p>

<p>&#8220;You harbor strange guests,&#8221; remarked
Spencer sternly, his cold glance transfixing
the little man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>&#8220;I can&#8217;t always know their antecedents, my
lord,&#8221; said the host, redder than ever, and in
an agony of uneasiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Lady Sunderland,
&#8220;you look as if you&#8217;d seen a ghost.
What in the wide world are you hatching now,
Spencer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing of importance,&#8221; he replied
coolly; &#8220;the Lion&#8217;s Head is turning Jacobite,
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy on us!&#8221; ejaculated Lady Sunderland,
with pious horror, &#8220;I thought &#8217;twas a
noted Whig house&mdash;and the king still in Newmarket,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, madam&mdash;your ladyship, I do protest,&#8221;
put in the landlord.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut!&#8221; said Dr. Radcliffe, waving him
aside, &#8220;we&#8217;ll excuse you. A dead Jacobite&#8217;s
no great matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A dead Jacobite?&#8221; screamed Lady Dacres
shrilly; &#8220;you make me faint! Here man, another
glass of what-d&#8217;-ye-call-it?&mdash;hypocrite?&#8221;
and she drank it with a sigh, fanning herself.</p>

<p>Spencer frowned, rising and walking to the
window, and apparently looking out into the
black night beyond. The landlord, taking advantage
of his opportunity, slid out of the
door with alacrity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>&#8220;There has been a duel, madam,&#8221; explained
Radcliffe, shuffling the cards, &#8220;in the long
meadow&mdash;and the provost-marshal may look
into it later.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, dear,&#8221; simpered Lady Sunderland,
looking over her cards, &#8220;was any one killed?
I&#8217;ll raise the wager to nine shillings&mdash;oh, la&mdash;the
doctor has a mourneval!&#8221; she added,
aside to Lady Dacres.</p>

<p>&#8220;A young Irishman, Trevor, was desperately
wounded,&#8221; replied Radcliffe; &#8220;a splendid
swordsman, but his blade broke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Lady Sunderland, &#8220;that
charming young man?&#8221; she shook her head
mournfully; &#8220;his legs were beautifully symmetrical.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he lose one?&#8221; tittered Lady Dacres,
clutching at her cards with greedy fingers; &#8220;you
said nine shillings more?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Sunderland nodded; she held three
kings and hoped to win. &#8220;The doctor has
Tiddy and Towser both,&#8221; she whispered behind
her fan.</p>

<p>At the moment, Betty came into the room.
Her face was pale but she showed no signs of
the tempest.</p>

<p>&#8220;He had an ugly wound, madam,&#8221; Dr. Radcliffe
said, playing a card leisurely; &#8220;his chances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
of life amount to that,&#8221; the physician made a
significant gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, Betty, come here and listen to
this awful tale,&#8221; said Lady Sunderland; &#8220;your
friend, Mr. Trevor, killed&mdash;oh, by the way,
who did it, doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Spencer had turned from the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Savile,&#8221; he answered coldly, &#8220;and he did
well. It seems he suspected him&mdash;thought
him a disguised Jacobite and has called him out
twice to kill him&mdash;this time he has probably
done it. And now it is rumored that the
fellow is one of those excepted in the late act
of Parliament. The country is flooded with
these rascals, constantly menacing its safety and
the king&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How romantic,&#8221; sighed Lady Sunderland,
throwing her cards; &#8220;there,&#8221; she crowed,
&#8220;three kings&mdash;Meg, I&#8217;ve got you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Dacres replied by tossing her cards on
the table with a scream of triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, confound it!&#8221; cried Lady Sunderland
furiously; &#8220;the hussy has a gleek of aces!
You&#8217;re an old cheat, Meg!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Dacres laughed immoderately, gathering
in the coin with eager fingers. The other
old gambler eyed her with fury, her headdress
quivering. Dr. Radcliffe, who knew it was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
fashion to fleece the men at table, looked on indifferently,
keeping up his talk with Spencer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot see why Savile had to kill him for
a Jacobite,&#8221; he remarked, deliberately taking
snuff from an elaborate box with the arms of
the Princess of Denmark on it; &#8220;the provost-marshal
can see to them. We all know that
the Habeas Corpus Act is suspended on account
of the plots against the king&#8217;s life. Savile&#8217;s
motive must have been more human than that,
my lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>Spencer shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was doing a high duty, sir,&#8221; he replied
pompously, &#8220;he was ridding his country of a
traitor. Savile&#8217;s a fine fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a murderer!&#8221; said Betty sharply.</p>

<p>She stood with her hand on the back of her
mother&#8217;s chair and her tall figure seemed to
tower. The doctor gave her a shrewd glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You love heroics, Elizabeth,&#8221; her brother
replied with a drawl, but his face turned white&mdash;a
danger signal.</p>

<p>Betty did not look at him; she fixed her
eyes on the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will he die?&#8221; she asked, and her voice
was perfectly controlled.</p>

<p>Radcliffe was thoughtful and did not answer
for a moment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>&#8220;There is one chance in a thousand,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;there would have been more, but this political
stir and hubbub has compelled them to
spirit him away, and a journey&mdash;&#8221; he shrugged
his shoulders; &#8220;I should say six feet of earth,
madam, would end it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew her breath sharply; to her all the
candles in the room seemed to be revolving in
a death-dance.</p>

<p>&#8220;He ought to die,&#8221; said Spencer piously,
&#8220;a Jacobite and a renegade. By Saint Thomas,
we&#8217;re well rid of him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;La, how romantic it is!&#8221; Lady Sunderland
said, shuffling her cards and glaring at
her simpering rival.</p>

<p>Betty walked past them and out into the
anteroom, where she met Lord Savile leaning
on Mr. Benham&#8217;s arm. His neck was bound
up and swathed in lace, and one arm was in a
sling. He bowed low with a white face and
languishing eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a brave fellow half killed for love
of you, my lady,&#8221; said Mr. Benham, with gallantry.</p>

<p>Betty halted; tall and straight as an arrow,
her eyes sparkling. No one anticipated the
lightning.</p>

<p>Savile smiled. &#8220;Dear Lady Clancarty,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
said, in a weak voice, &#8220;I am your humblest
servant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a murderer, sir,&#8221; she replied, in a
terrible tone; &#8220;let me never see your face
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she swept on and left them standing
there in blank amazement.</p>

<p>In her own room she fell on Alice&#8217;s neck in
a passion of tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Alice, Alice!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I have driven
him to his death.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Alice&mdash;who had heard all that evening,
in the agony of her ladyship&#8217;s first grief
and terror&mdash;Alice clasped her close, forgetting
the great distance between them and remembering
only her devotion to this beautiful and
wilful creature.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not know you cared so much,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;I never thought that he might be Lord
Clancarty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I felt it from the first, Alice,&#8221; Lady
Betty said; &#8220;there was something in his bearing
toward me&mdash;his tone&mdash;I knew he was
my husband, I felt it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;my lady, you sent
him away!&#8221; the girl murmured, in a tone of
wonder.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>Betty&#8217;s head dropped. &#8220;Yes, he has gone!&#8221;
she said, &#8220;gone&mdash;my own true love&mdash;and
desperately wounded, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, gone,&#8221; said Alice, venturing on a
tearful remonstrance; &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand you,
my lady, I can&#8217;t indeed! One moment, you
are all tenderness for the poor gentleman, the
next, you are driving him into exile with your
coldness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exile? Oh, no, no!&#8221; cried Lady Betty
passionately, &#8220;he shall not go without me. I
love him, my girl, I love him&mdash;can&#8217;t you
understand? &#8217;Twas that which made me feel
so&mdash;feel that he only claimed me, did not woo
me. You are as dull as any man, Alice,&#8221; she
walked to and fro, beating her hands together,
&#8220;my love, my poor love!&#8221; she sighed and
then suddenly her mood changed, she raised
her head resolutely.</p>

<p>&#8220;My hood and cloak, Alice,&#8221; she said
quickly, &#8220;and my vizard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam, &#8217;tis very late,&#8221; remonstrated the
girl.</p>

<p>Betty stamped her foot. &#8220;I am your mistress,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;obey me&mdash;you forget your
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, my lady,&#8221; said Alice sadly, &#8220;I do not
forget&mdash;but I love you!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>Her generous-hearted mistress repented in
a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; she said gently, &#8220;I know it,
Alice, but I cannot be advised&mdash;I must find
him.&#8221; She stopped, her face white under the
hood that the girl was adjusting: &#8220;O Alice,
he may be dying!&#8221;</p>

<p class="ph3">LADY BETTY&#8217;S SEARCH</p>


<p class="drop-cap">THOUGH the stars were out, the
night was black as pitch and the
courtyard of the inn was only lighted
by the broad bands of red that flared across it
from the gaping doors of hall and kitchen,
serving to make the surrounding darkness
more palpable. So it was that Lady Betty and
Alice&mdash;cloaked and hooded&mdash;nearly stumbled
against young Mackie, and would not have
known him but for his exclamation of impatience.
He took them for kitchen wenches,
and when Lady Betty cried out his name, he
stopped short with a gasp of sheer amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Sir Edward, &#8217;twas you&mdash;of all men&mdash;I
wanted to see!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>Poor Mackie, if he could have taken her at
her word! But, alas, her tone belied her
words and his heart sank drearily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You here, my lady!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;what
has happened? I am at your service; I pray
you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>But she cut him short.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>She mentioned no name, but the young man
understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;His servant removed him two hours ago,
Lady Clancarty,&#8221; he replied quietly, &#8220;whither,
I know not. The man, a wild Irish clown,
would not trust me, though, &#8217;pon my honor, I
meant to serve&mdash;Mr. Trevor,&#8221; his voice faltered
so at the name that she was again assured
that he had divined their secret and a weight
slipped from her heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was he dying?&#8221; she asked very low, but
the tremor in her voice thrilled her listener.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; he stammered, &#8220;I pray
not, my lady, for he is a brave man.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laid her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said simply, &#8220;he is my
husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Mackie bent his head and kissed her
fingers reverently.</p>

<p>&#8220;He also trusted me, madam,&#8221; he said, and
she did not see the pain in the boy&#8217;s eyes; &#8220;I
shall endeavor to deserve it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Betty was not thinking of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must find him,&#8221; she said shivering, &#8220;I
must find him!&#8221; and a sob choked her voice.</p>

<p>Young Mackie was silent. From the kitchen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
came the hubbub of voices, the clatter of dishes;
while, looking over Betty&#8217;s shoulder, he saw
Spencer and Savile cross the main hall, arm in
arm, their heads together. Sir Edward knew
well enough that Savile had tried to kill Clancarty
and he set his teeth, for he saw her cloaked
figure sway and quiver in the passion of emotion
that shook her. He was a generous fellow
and he forgot himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will try to find him, my lady,&#8221; he said
in a low tone, glancing cautiously at the hall
door, &#8220;he can&#8217;t be very far away, he could not
travel; that man has hidden him somewhere
because of the stir made by the duel&mdash;I think
his identity was very near discovery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but how to find
him&mdash;oh, Sir Edward, I must do it! He&mdash;he
may be in need of a surgeon&mdash;of care&mdash;of
everything!&#8221; she broke off wildly, and then,
&#8220;Come, Alice, we must go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he detained her. &#8220;Whither, madam?&#8221;
he asked gravely, &#8220;not in a vain search&mdash;at
night&mdash;for&mdash;for him?&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew herself up proudly. &#8220;Do you
think I will let my husband die thus?&mdash;and
stir no finger to help him?&#8221; she asked bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you will let me go with you,&#8221; he
said quietly, taking his place beside her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>She hesitated and quickly assented. &#8220;If you
will,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;since it is late and we are
only two women&mdash;but we must make haste,&#8221;
and she ran down the old stone steps into the
garden, taking the very path she had walked
with Clancarty. Mackie and Alice followed
her silently, though both were convinced of
the fruitlessness of such an errand at such an
hour.</p>

<p>But the night had worn on many hours
more and the moon had risen before Betty
acknowledged that her quest was vain. Meanwhile,
young Mackie had patiently searched in
every tavern and inn in Newmarket; he had
invaded all the alleys and byways, all the nooks
and corners, and inquired of grooms and
porters and stable-men&mdash;but to no purpose.
Denis had covered his retreat with more skill
than Sir Edward had looked for. If the truth
be told, the Irishman was no new hand at the
business and he understood it well, having followed
Lord Clancarty in his adventurous life,
from Dublin, and later in a wild career on the
Continent when the gay young nobleman had
kept pace with his fellow exiles of high birth
and slim purses, but unlimited daring. It was
not the first duel nor the first cause for flight,
and Denis had spirited the wounded man away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
and left no sign. Even Betty, determined and
vigilant as she was, was forced to acknowledge
herself defeated, and she walked drearily back
to the Lion&#8217;s Head with an aching heart. He
believed her indifferent to him&mdash;would he
ever send her a message or a token again?
Never; she was sure of it, and she bowed her
head in dejection&mdash;Lady Betty, who was never
crestfallen. She and Alice crept in, at last, by
the garden way and fled to her apartments in
no little trepidation, but they fancied themselves
safe when they found that Lady Sunderland
had gone to bed, to get her beauty sleep, and
the woman, Melissa, slept in her room that
night, in the absence of the countess&#8217; own
attendant.</p>

<p>Lady Betty did not sleep nor did she open
her heart to the faithful girl who was nearly as
grieved as she was to see her trouble. She
knelt for hours by the window looking out
over the moonlit garden where the shadows
were black between the hedgerows. It was a
night of agony; to know that he might be
dying&mdash;dying with hard thoughts of her indifference&mdash;almost
within reach of her and yet
so far. She was his wife, she thought with
sharp pain, and yet he could not send her
word&mdash;and she did not deserve it. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
dying, because Savile had been determined to
kill him: he had divined the secret, he was
resolved to remove her husband. Betty saw
it all; she had wrung some admissions from
Mackie, the rest she knew by intuition.</p>

<p>She had a high spirit&mdash;all her life she had
had her way at last, in spite of her heartless,
frivolous mother and her selfish, brilliant
father, and this was a trial hard to bear.
Clancarty was the first man who had not done
her homage, who met her on her own ground
and demanded that she should love him.
Perhaps it was that which won her; howbeit,
her eyes were dim with tears as she looked out
of the window and looked, indeed, until the
sun rose on another day.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW</p>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was a small and desolate room, with bare
rafters overhead, and the wind rattling
fiercely at the old casements, while Denis
was trying to keep a sickly fire of green wood
alive upon the hearth. The floor was of
stone, cold and bare, save for a few rushes
strewn beside the truckle bed, and there was
no light but that from the sputtering logs and
one poor taper; there were only two chairs
and one small table in the room beside the
bed, but all was scrupulously clean, though
barren and chilly beyond description.</p>

<p>And on the bed lay Lord Clancarty, his
cheeks flushed with fever, his hair dishevelled,
his eyes shining, and his hands ever and anon
clutching at the coverlet fiercely whenever
any chance movement gave him pain.</p>

<p>If the aspect of the place was poor, it was
also desolately lonely; no sound reached their
ears but the rustling of the wind in the tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
tops without and the creaking of the old building
itself. It was an old farmhouse, the
dwelling of the widow of a Jacobite&mdash;for
England was honey-combed with conspiracies
and counter-conspiracies&mdash;and this woman, a
rigid believer in the old order of things, had the
courage to take the wounded nobleman under
her roof; she could give him shelter, but as
for comforts she had none to give. Here,
too, with her connivance, Denis smuggled
a young surgeon, one of the faithful, to tend
the wound that the famous Radcliffe had
dressed with his own hands on the field.
The young practitioner shared the doubts of
his senior, and shook his head gravely; the
wounded man might live, but he was quite as
likely to die. So, with these gloomy predictions,
and the still more gloomy aid of the
solemn visaged widow, Denis was left with
almost an empty purse to guard and nurse the
feverish patient.</p>

<p>Stricken with profound anxieties, the faithful
Irishman fed the fire, kneeling before it,
his back toward his master, to hide a face that
betrayed his feelings too plainly. On the table
lay Lord Clancarty&#8217;s cloak and plumed hat
and the hilt of the sword that had served him
so ill and there, too, was his pistol primed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
ready for use. He lay watching Denis, fever
flushed but in his senses, though more than
once that night his mind had wandered.</p>

<p>The stillness of the place was broken by the
stamping of a horse&#8217;s feet at no great distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; the wounded man asked
sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our horses, sir,&#8221; replied Denis, still kneeling
at the hearth; &#8220;they&#8217;re in the shed outside,
me lord, an&#8217; indade &#8217;tis fitter fer thim
than fer yer lordship here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clancarty smiled sadly. &#8220;It matters little,
Denis, and is like to matter less. How far
are we from Newmarket?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not far, sir, this house stands off th&#8217; road
ter Bishop-Stortford, a half mile loike from the
road, in a patch of timber; a very pretty
hiding-place&mdash;I&#8217;ve hed me eye on it fer a
couple of wakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You thought I would come to this, then?
Ah, Denis, I fear you know me too well, old
rogue!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indade, sir, I&#8217;ve known ye from a boy
in Munster, an&#8217; I nivir knew ye to take care
of yerself. Faix, it&#8217;s a broken head ye&#8217;ll
be afther havin&#8217; more often thin a whole
wan.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>Clancarty laughed softly, his feverish eyes
on the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Denis,&#8221; he said dreamily, &#8220;do you remember
the wild rides over the green fields
of Ireland?&#8221;</p>

<p>Denis bent low over the hearth fanning the
blaze, fighting the damp and the green wood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afther remimbering, yer lordship,&#8221; he
replied hoarsely.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long way back, to those days,&#8221; said
Lord Clancarty; &#8220;the skies were blue then.
I&#8217;m a poor devil now, Denis, and like to
die&mdash;&#8221; his voice died away, more from faintness
than emotion, and after awhile he asked
for water.</p>

<p>Denis rose and gave it to him, lifting his
head as gently as a woman, and as he took the
glass from the wounded man&#8217;s lips he turned
his own head away&mdash;but not soon enough, a
hot tear fell on the earl&#8217;s forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Saint Patrick, Denis, I must be far gone
when you weep!&#8221; Clancarty said, touched in
spite of himself, &#8220;I did not know you could,
you old heart of oak!&#8221;</p>

<p>Denis brushed the moisture from his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I remimber an ould man in County Kerry,
me lord, who nivir shid a tear until his wife was
coming out of a fit, and thin he took on loike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
anny wild gossoon. He&#8217;d bin gitting ready
fer a wake an&#8217; hed ter give it all up, and whin
his neighbors accused him of it, he said he
nivir wept unless a person was gitting well,
an&#8217; thin he wept fer joy&mdash;&#8217;tis so with me,
me lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Clancarty smiled, turning his face to
the wall. He was deeply touched at the
simple fellow&#8217;s devotion. There was silence
for awhile; the fire crackled and leaped up the
chimney, lighting up the room just in time, for
the single taper sputtered and went out.</p>

<p>It was at this time that Lady Clancarty
and Sir Edward were searching the streets of
Newmarket.</p>

<p>Lord Clancarty turned his head wearily and
looking down at his own hand remembered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Denis,&#8221; he said in a low tone, &#8220;did you
give the ring and the message to my lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>Denis had his back to him again, his square
sturdy outline between him and the blaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, me lord,&#8221; he answered stolidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And she?&#8221; the fever burned on Clancarty&#8217;s
cheeks, his eyes shone; &#8220;how did she
take it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very quiet loike, me lord,&#8221; replied Denis
bluntly, &#8220;she wanted to know what hed happened,
but I dared not tell her ladyship.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>&#8220;She inquired, though? she was anxious?&#8221;
asked the earl eagerly.</p>

<p>Denis was stubborn. &#8220;Me lord, she asked
what hed happened&mdash;nothing more. She&#8217;s a
great lady, sir, and as proud as anny quane.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wounded lover sighed and turned again
to the wall: here was no consolation, and in
his bitterness he called her heartless. The
desolate place, his almost exhausted resources,
his painful wound, all combined to shake even
his proud resolution; he was lonely and he was
desperate. In his fevered brain rose many
visions of Betty, the beautiful, the careless,
charming Betty that he had known. What
heart there was beneath that beautiful exterior
he did not know; but this he knew&mdash;he was
an outcast from home and friends, a desperate
and forsaken man and dangerously wounded.
He was no novice in affairs of this kind and
knew well the nature of his hurt and what lack
of care would do for it. His life passed in
quick review before him; its ambitions, its
wild adventures, its dark spots of reckless dissipations,
and now this end&mdash;this wretched,
thwarted, forsaken end&mdash;creeping away like a
wounded beast to die alone. It might well
bring bitterness to so proud and daring a spirit
as his. He cursed his fate, but it is to be feared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
that he did not pray. His religion had been a
matter of convenience, like the religion of many
gay young soldiers of his time. It failed him
now and she failed him too,&mdash;the woman who
had taken such possession of his heart and
swept him out of the common way into a
higher passion. He loved her&mdash;and she despised
him. He groaned sharply as if in
bodily pain; the faithful Irishman was at his
side in a moment, but he waved him away.
His soul was wrestling with despair and with
hunger for the sight of her. He, a strong
man and a proud one, in that hour of physical
agony and loneliness, longed to see her, to hear
her voice before he died&mdash;if die he must, yet
he would have died rather than send for her&mdash;such
was his pride.</p>

<p>The night wore on; the horses stamping
restlessly in the shed, the wind increasing in
violence until the old house creaked, quivering
like a broken reed. Denis sat staring at
the fire, his honest face distorted with grief and
now and then a slow tear creeping down his
furrowed cheek. The wound was a desperate
one, and counting all the things against the
patient,&mdash;exposure, lack of nursing and food
and comforts, the man did not believe he would
live, and he loved him like a son; he had carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
him on his shoulder as a baby; he had
taught the little lad to sit his horse and use his
sword, and he had followed him in Ireland, in
France, in Flanders, through weal and woe&mdash;to
this! Poor Denis, he too had his night of
tears and lamentations.</p>

<p>Toward midnight Clancarty&#8217;s mind wandered
a little and he babbled like a child of
the green turf of Ireland and the streams
where he had paddled barefoot, and of the
wild birds overhead. He talked of battles
and sieges and at last of her, of Betty, and
Denis cursed her in his heart as their evil
angel, the lodestar that had drawn the young
earl to his fate. Now and then through the
night the wounded man called for water, but
toward morning he fell asleep, and Denis
dropped on his knees, praying to all the
saints to send healing on the wings of that fitful
slumber.</p>

<p>But with the night the delirium and the
weakness of spirit passed together. At daybreak
the earl opened his eyes and looked
quietly into Denis&#8217;s worn face. He smiled,
the old reckless smile, if somewhat weaker and
paler than usual. He groped feebly under
his pillow and handed the man his purse.</p>

<p>&#8220;A small store, Denis,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but &#8217;tis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
yours now, to do with as you can. If I die&mdash;ah,
you must even bury me here, I suppose,
though I long for Irish soil to cover me!
For the rest&mdash;go home, Denis, take no risks
for my sake. Faith, a dead man will not need
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Denis said nothing, he could not; he stood
staring at the floor.</p>

<p>Lord Clancarty laughed a little bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go tend the horses, man,&#8221; he said; &#8220;you
saw Neerwinden&mdash;why do you stand there
like a woman? Death comes but once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my lord,&#8221; said Denis, and the tears
ran down his cheeks, &#8220;ye shall not die.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clancarty turned his face to the wall lest he,
too, should show weakness.</p>

</div></div>

<p>he murmured faintly,</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;My own Rosaleen!&#8221;</p>

<p>So Denis went to tend the horses, drawing
his sleeve across his eyes and hating Lady

devoted heart.</p>

<p class="ph3">&#8220;UNTIL DEATH US DO PART&#8221;</p>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was nearly a week later and Lady
Betty&#8217;s chair was passing down the main
street of Newmarket when she espied
Denis at the corner of a lane that ran between
a mercer&#8217;s shop and Drake&#8217;s. She stopped
her chair, and springing from it ran after him,
ran quite regardless of the people in the
street who stood gaping at the charming young
woman running after a groom. She overtook
him at the end of the lane; they were behind
the mercer&#8217;s shop, and Denis started at the sight
of her and stood irresolute, eying her grimly.
She snatched the vizard from her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is your master?&#8221; she demanded
breathlessly, &#8220;where is Lord Clancarty?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Irishman shut his lips stubbornly; he
did not trust the daughter of Lord Sunderland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you not tell me?&#8221; cried Betty, in
distress, &#8220;I know that he is wounded&mdash;I
must see him! I will not be denied! I command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
you&mdash;nay,&#8221; she added, reading his
inflexible face, &#8220;I beg and pray you,&mdash;give
me news of him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Denis eyed her closely, relenting just a little,
and that little was enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s very ill,&#8221; he said sullenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he in danger?&#8221; cried Lady Clancarty,
tears gathering in her eyes, &#8220;tell me, man, tell
me,&#8221; and she wrung her hands. &#8220;Can&#8217;t gold
tempt you? Take me to him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Denis made a strange motion; it seemed as
if he would snatch her purse and then forbore
to do it, but his eyes devoured it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faix, I don&#8217;t know av I can thrust ye,&#8221;
he said, looking at her keenly; &#8220;ye&#8217;ve done
him harm enough already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I trust you!&#8221; cried Lady Betty, &#8220;I
am your master&#8217;s wife,&mdash;take me to him.
See, I will go with you alone&mdash;can&#8217;t you
trust me now?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man looked down yet a little while, in
evident hesitation, and she watched him,
trembling, not with fear, like another woman,
but with hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faix, I&#8217;ll take ye,&#8221; he said bluntly, &#8220;if
ye&#8217;ll go alone. Look ye, me lady, if ye bethray
him, I&#8217;d as lief kill ye as not. I love
me lord!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>The color rose in Betty&#8217;s face, softly, sweetly,
her eyes shone.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so do I!&#8221; she said; &#8220;lead on, I will
follow&mdash;and alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, thin,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;&#8217;tis a long
way an&#8217; the place isn&#8217;t fit fer a foine lady, but
he&#8217;s there&mdash;tho&#8217;, by the Virgin, I don&#8217;t
know what he&#8217;ll say ter me fer bringing ye!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke he cast a glance back at the
chair and its bearers waiting at the mouth of
the lane, the men staring after their mistress,
and with them a knot of idlers who had gathered
to watch the countess. Lady Clancarty turned
her back upon them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lead on!&#8221; she commanded, impatient
and imperious.</p>

<p>Denis led the way down the narrow lane,
out of sight of the group at the mercer&#8217;s shop,
and into another byway, and so on through
the outskirts of Newmarket. He did not
take the public road but struck across the
fields, passing close to the spot where Lord
Clancarty had fought the duel. Lady Betty
shuddered as they approached it. They were
out of sight of the last straggling houses now,
crossing the meadows; the sun shone as it had
upon that day when she had walked first with
Clancarty, but there was more of a touch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
autumn upon the scene. Here, beyond the
light green turf, was a field of stubble, and
there, in the green hedgerow, were yellow
leaves; and the stream, too, that flowed across
the meadows, had brown depths and shadows
where the pebbles lay thickest, and the purple
distance took on gray.</p>

<p>They had left the open and were skirting a
little woodland where the dry leaves rustled
overhead, and once she heard the &#8220;kourre,
kourre!&#8221; of the pigeons.</p>

<p>Whither was he going? Lady Betty wondered.
The place grew more and more
solitary; they followed a path, but one so
little used that briars fell across it and one of
them tore her frock: but she went on fearlessly,
for never did a braver heart throb in a
woman&#8217;s bosom. Her spirit was intrepid.
She looked about her through the sparsely
growing trees and saw long distances without
a sign of life or habitation, and still Denis
plodded on and she followed, pity and love
and remorse growing in her heart at every
step. Her lover and her husband in poverty
and obscurity, a proscribed rebel, and she rich.
Nothing could have appealed so to her full
heart. The thought stung her and the tears
gathered on her dark lashes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>As Denis had predicted, the walk was a long
one, but she did not heed it, she kept steadily
on behind him; and at last, through an opening
in the trees, she saw two horses grazing in
a little strip of greensward, and beyond, the
lonely farmhouse. As her guide turned towards
it Betty caught her breath and stood still&mdash;for
a single moment&mdash;the place was so
poor, so dark, so uninviting, and the vicinity
of Newmarket swarmed with banditti; even
when the king&#8217;s coach took the road it had to
be strongly guarded. This old, weather-stained
brown house, with half its window shutters
broken, the green moss on its slanting gables,
and the strong, iron-bound door, with the
broken stone before it, was sad and forbidding
enough without the silence and the woodland
shadows that enfolded it. Betty stood and
stared at it apprehensively, and then she thought
of Clancarty. Her hesitation was so soon over
that the man, her guide, was scarcely aware of
it. He went on steadily, hearing her light
step rustling on the fallen leaves behind him,
and at last he stopped at the door and waited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he here?&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>Denis nodded, opening the door and guiding
her into the kitchen where the widow, Clancarty&#8217;s
hostess and nurse, stood before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
hearth stirring a stew in a great pot that was
suspended on a hook over blazing logs. At
the sound of their entrance she turned sharply
and stared at Lady Clancarty in grim amazement,
not uttering a word. Her stern, sad
face and suspicious eye sent the hot blood up
under her ladyship&#8217;s vizard, but even this,
though it embarrassed her, could not hold
her back. She stood an instant, though, in the
centre of the bare kitchen, in her gay furbelows,
holding up her skirts with one hand
while the other involuntarily adjusted her
mask. Meanwhile, the widow continued to
eye her sternly, even while she stirred the
broth.</p>

<p>Denis was quick enough to perceive the
difficulty.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis Lady Clancarty,&#8221; he said bluntly to
the woman, indicating Lady Betty&#8217;s lovely
figure with a backward sweep of the hand.</p>

<p>Clancarty&#8217;s hostess courtesied profoundly, but
the fair intruder felt that those stern eyes said
plainly, &#8220;A likely story, the brazen hussy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come to see my husband,&#8221; Betty
faltered, her voice trembling a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; retorted the widow
grimly, and turning her back deliberately, she
began to flourish the huge spoon again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>The poor young wife, meanwhile, fled after
Denis across the kitchen, her heart beating
wildly. He was waiting in the entry and led
her down the hall to the opposite side of the
house, before he finally halted at a closed door
and waited. At a sign from her he let her
enter alone. The place was poorly lighted by
small windows, and as she entered and heard
the door close behind her, her heart stood still.
And then&mdash;</p>

<p>Poor Betty, her tears blinded her; she forgot
the suspicious widow. The room was so
poor, so bare, so wretched; the low, dark
rafters, the stone floor, the miserable furniture.
And stretched on the bed lay her husband, white
as death; his head turned so that he could not
see her, but she saw him, saw the pallor, the
wasted cheek, the helpless figure. She did not
move and he had not heard her enter, he
seemed to be sleeping. She took off her mask
and stood waiting. What would he say? For
the first time her courage failed her, her knees
trembled under her. Would he hate her, and
despise her for coming? She stirred and he
heard the rustle and looked up. In a moment
it seemed as if the sun had risen and shone
full upon his face: it was glorified, but still
she did not go nearer to him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I see it is but a dream!
It has mocked me before. My fever must
be upon me again, but, oh, sweet vision,
stay with me this time, else I perish here of
despair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you forgive me?&#8221; she sobbed, running
to him and falling on her knees beside the
bed, &#8220;oh, I have suffered too, the wound that
hurt you pierced me also to the heart! Forgive
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>He put his arm around her, drawing her
close, with all his feeble strength, and looking
at her with hungry eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;My darling!&#8221; he said tenderly, &#8220;&#8217;tis you&mdash;you
in the flesh?&mdash;and you came to see
me?&mdash;the beggar, the exile, the traitor&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t!&#8221; cried Betty, in a passion
of grief, &#8220;I never meant it&mdash;it was my tongue,
my reckless, wicked tongue&mdash;oh, my lord,
forgive me!&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled; he was so weak that tears
gathered in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have I to forgive, &#8216;my own Rosaleen&#8217;?&#8221;
he asked tenderly; &#8220;I am not worthy
of you&mdash;I am, indeed, an exile and a vagrant,
my queen, and no mate for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are my husband,&#8221; Betty said, blushing
divinely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>&#8220;Betty,&#8221; he whispered soft and low, &#8220;you
have never kissed me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never kissed any man, my Lord
Clancarty,&#8221; she replied softly, her face radiant,
&#8220;I will never kiss any man&mdash;but the one I
love best!&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her silently, his eyes glowing,
holding her closer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Betty,&#8221; he murmured, &#8220;do you love me?&mdash;your
husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty did not reply in words. She put her
arms around his neck and kissed him tenderly,
laying her soft cheek against his with a
sob.</p>

<p>&#8220;My darling,&#8221; he said, after a pause, &#8220;it is
too much to ask you to leave all and follow
me&mdash;too much. I am only a beggar, Betty,
and an outcast!&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up into his eyes and he thought
her face had never been so beautiful.</p>

<p>&#8220;My husband,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>His tears wet her cheek as he kissed her
again and again.</p>

<p>&#8220;My best beloved,&#8221; he said, &#8220;&#8216;my own
Rosaleen&#8217;! &#8216;Until death us do part,&#8217; do you
remember? The bond was made in heaven,
Betty!&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled through her tears.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>&#8220;I love you,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;and shall
forever and forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you leave all, Betty?&#8221; he asked
longingly, &#8220;all, and follow me into exile and
poverty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unto the ends of the earth, my lord and
master,&#8221; she answered smiling, the old Betty
suddenly peeping out at him from her dark eyes;
&#8220;if I have you I have all!&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>Warm hearted, impulsive, careless Lady
Betty was not one to give her heart unless she
gave it royally.</p>

<p>After a moment she raised her face, rosy and
tear-stained, but smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you know me at first?&#8221; she asked,
&#8220;in the woods at Althorpe? Did you divine
who I was?&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed softly, taking her face between
his hands and holding it fondly, framed thus,
so she could not hide it from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I know the sun when it shone?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;Ah, my little witch, I knew you! I
had been watching you for two days and more,
whenever I could catch a glimpse of you. Did
you know me, madam?&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled adorably and tried to hide her
blushes in his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt it,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;I think I knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
you by intuition&mdash;from that first moment&mdash;but
afterwards&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But afterwards?&#8221; he asked relentlessly.</p>

<p>She laughed, her eyes shining. &#8220;You tried
to deceive me,&#8221; she said, &#8220;in the garden&mdash;you
remember?&mdash;for a little while, I thought you
couldn&#8217;t be <i>you</i>, and&mdash;&#8221; her voice trailed off,
her face was as scarlet as any poppy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And?&#8221; he persisted gleefully, holding her
still.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought&mdash;I thought that I had given
my heart to a stranger&mdash;and I was married&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221;
she broke off, she could not speak for
his kisses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you have divorced the beggar for
me?&#8221; he whispered maliciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Donough!&#8221; she cried, throwing her
arms around his neck in the very ecstasy of
her joy at her escape from such a dilemma, &#8220;O
Donough, it would have broken my heart if
you hadn&#8217;t been&mdash;<i>you</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again a silence and then,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you put your foot on the shamrock?&#8221;
he whispered.</p>

<p>She hid her face on his neck. &#8220;I wanted
it,&#8221; she confessed, in a smothered tone, &#8220;I
wanted it to keep! Where is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew it from his breast, a withered sprig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
folded in a piece of paper, and she seized upon
it and kissed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you shall not&mdash;not
even my shamrock shall share your kisses with
me! That is one stolen from me, madam,
give me the shamrock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; she defied him, clasping it to
her own bosom, &#8220;never&mdash;&#8217;tis mine to wear
for your sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes shone. &#8220;My Irish beauty,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;<i>roisin bheag dubh</i>!&mdash;if I may not have
the shamrock I must have the kiss back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you treat me so that last night?&#8221;
he went on, &#8220;you perverse witch, you tormentor,
you deserve to suffer for flouting
your lord and master.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was it,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you came in with
the air of a conquering hero; I thought you
would not woo me, that you claimed me too
much like a master; that, perhaps, you didn&#8217;t
love me, but only felt that you were my
husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed quietly. &#8220;You coquette!&#8221; he
said fondly, &#8220;you knew I loved you&mdash;you
saw it in my eyes, for I know they devoured
you&mdash;you felt it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty hung her head guiltily. &#8220;I could not
help it,&#8221; she said, with a little sob, &#8220;I loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
you,&mdash;and suddenly I thought you knew it,
and were careless of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>He kissed her hands softly. &#8220;You knew I
loved you!&#8221; he exclaimed reproachfully.</p>

<p>She looked up through her tears. &#8220;I love
to hear you say it,&#8221; she murmured rapturously.</p>

<p>After awhile she looked around the miserable
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;My love,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;can&#8217;t I take you
away from this awful place? It breaks my
heart to have you here! With that female
dragon, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, grieve not, Betty,&#8221; he answered
smiling, &#8220;it shines with you in it. How I
shall picture you here&mdash;in your white and
pink gown, with the little hood on your head&mdash;the
house is a palace, dear! It is too good
for a poor man now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are poor!&#8221; she exclaimed, her
tears breaking out afresh, &#8220;you are poor and
I&mdash;I have everything!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I am rich in having
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>But her tears fell. She could not leave him
so, she cried, clinging to him; the thought of
that poor place would break her heart! And
it took all his persuasion and caresses to win
a smile from her again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>&#8220;And I must go,&#8221; she said at last, showing
an April face, smiles and tears together, &#8220;I
must go, or else they will miss me, and if
Spencer found you here, I know not what he
would do; he hates a Jacobite! But, oh,
my darling, &#8217;twill not be long ere I shall
send some token to you, or have some message
from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not long,&#8221; he said, his eyes sparkling, &#8220;not
long, dear Betty! As soon as I can walk&mdash;a
plague upon this wound&mdash;as soon as I can
move I will come to you! I can&#8217;t die now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the risk of it!&#8221; she cried, but her face
shone, and then suddenly, &#8220;Donough,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;why had you to fight my Lord Savile?
and after all I did to prevent it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He insulted me, my love,&#8221; Clancarty replied,
&#8220;and&mdash;and, well, dear heart, after that
night I thought you might care for him and
not for me, and it drove me mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty smiled enchantingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were jealous,&#8221; she said, &#8220;jealous of
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was mad with it, Betty,&#8221; he declared
passionately; &#8220;and here I lie, curse this wound,
like a log, and other men are near you, bask
in your smiles, kiss your hand! It drives me
to destruction!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>And she looking down at him in his weakness,
thin and fever flushed,&mdash;she fell upon
her knees again beside him, holding her soft
cheek against his, and saying only two words&mdash;softly,
sweetly, with adorable tenderness&mdash;&#8220;My
husband!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Afterwards, in the loneliness of the woodland,
Betty pressed a full purse into Denis&#8217;s unreluctant
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a word to your lord&mdash;on your life!&#8221;
she charged him; &#8220;but get all he needs and
come to me for more&mdash;and we must move
him to some comfortable refuge at once. Mind
you, everything he needs and instantly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Denis&#8217;s face widened into a seraphic smile
as he pressed the purse fondly.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the Virgin, my lady,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I shall
have to be afther telling him a legend&mdash;faix,
he&#8217;ll think I&#8217;ve found an angel of a Jew, yer
ladyship!&#8221;</p>

<p class="ph3">MY LORD SPENCER</p>


<p class="drop-cap">IT happened that when Lady Clancarty came
back from her visit to the house in the
forest, weary and tear-stained but happier
and more peaceful, she found herself in trouble.
She had been gone a long time and unhappily
her absence had been noticed and commented
upon. Faithful and devoted as Alice was, she
was not quickwitted enough to invent excuses,
and was, indeed, thoroughly frightened and
distressed by her mistress&#8217; absence which she
could not help connecting in some way with
Lord Clancarty. There had been, in consequence,
a great hubbub at the Lion&#8217;s Head,
and men were running hither and yon; while
the servants, who had carried her chair, to save
themselves from blame had not failed to give
a highly colored account of her meeting with a
strange man in the lane and her disappearance
in his company. When Lady Betty came
quietly back through the garden, hoping to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
escape to her room unobserved, she met
Lord Spencer with his face as white as a sheet
and his lids drooped low over his eyes. He
stood in the door of the inn that opened upon
the court, and his sister came upon him so
unexpectedly that she had no time for flight.
She knew the signs too well, however, not to
be prepared, and her old spirit returned to her
stronger than ever, and she held her head high.
But Spencer did not intend to open the quarrel
there in a public place, his mood was more
dangerous. He was quite aware that the servants,
and even the landlord, were peeping at
them from the kitchen way, and he bowed
courteously to his sister and offered her his
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit me, madam, to escort you to our
mother,&#8221; he said so suavely that the culprit
shivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can go quite well alone, Charles,&#8221; she replied
passing him with a careless manner that was
scarcely a faithful indication of her mood; &#8220;I
am too weary to drink tea or play gleek,&#8221; she
added yawning; &#8220;faith, &#8217;tis tiresome to walk in
the fields.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Extremely so,&#8221; replied my lord, as smooth
as silk, &#8220;especially when you bring wood briars
back upon your farthingale.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>Lady Betty blushed red as a poppy as she
glanced down at the tell-tale twig caught in the
ruffles of her skirts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull it off, my dear,&#8221; she said sweetly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I fear the thorns,&#8221; he replied, with
distant politeness.</p>

<p>She plucked it away herself with a little
grimace.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wise, Charles,&#8221; she said, &#8220;&#8217;tis
well to keep your fingers out of other people&#8217;s
troubles.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bit his lip, giving her a furious glance as
she tripped up the stairs ahead of him. But,
though he followed more deliberately, he entered
Lady Sunderland&#8217;s room but a moment
after her, and in time to hear her reply to his
mother&#8217;s sharp inquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I walked a little way in the meadows,
madam,&#8221; said Betty, with delightful mendacity;
&#8220;you know you recommended it for my
complexion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A fine diversion,&#8221; remarked Lord Spencer,
with a sneer, &#8220;but who, pray, was your
companion?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Betty gave him a sidelong look that
spoke volumes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith,&#8221; she retorted, with a shrug, &#8220;the
world would be a dull place with no men in it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>Lady Sunderland tittered behind her fan; if
anything appealed to her, it was her daughter&#8217;s
absolute audacity. But Spencer was furious.</p>

<p>&#8220;You choose a fine subject for a jest,&#8221; he
said; &#8220;I would have you know, madam, that
my sister cannot run about Newmarket with a
groom!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Betty turned upon him like a fury.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not dare to say that to me again,&#8221; she
cried, her bosom heaving with passion; &#8220;you
forget to whom you speak! Do you think&mdash;do
you dare to think&mdash;that I am not as capable
as you of defending my own honor and
dignity? More, sir, I would have you know
that I am accountable to none but my father
and&mdash;my husband!&#8221; and she swept past him
and out of the room like a whirlwind.</p>

<p>The older countess sank back in her chair
and giggled like a girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;La!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;her spirit!&mdash;I&#8217;d
give ten guineas to see her do that over again,&mdash;and
you deserved it, Charles, my love.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her son gave her an exasperated look.</p>

<p>&#8220;That fellow is Clancarty&mdash;I am sure of
it,&#8221; he said fiercely, &#8220;and the minx is in communication
with him&mdash;but, by Saint Thomas,
I&#8217;ll break it up&mdash;if I have to break his head!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fudge, my love,&#8221; replied the countess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
tittering, &#8220;&#8217;twill take more than your wit to
keep two lovers apart; but never fear, she&#8217;ll
not give up her wealth and comfort to run
away with him&mdash;she has too much sense.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Spencer&#8217;s eyelids drooped lower.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll see that she never has the opportunity,
madam,&#8221; he said, in a cool voice that had the
effect of making Lady Sunderland shiver much
as Betty had.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lady Clancarty poured out her
hopes and fears and half-formed plans to Alice
Lynn. The first thing to be done was to get
the wounded man into a place of comfort, where
he would also be secure, and in this Alice could
help more than her mistress had dreamed.
The girl had an uncle living in Cambridge, a
mercer, and a man with Jacobite leanings, and
she at once suggested his house as a possible
shelter for Lord Clancarty. After some discussion,
her mistress eagerly accepted this
opportunity, especially as she must leave
Newmarket soon for London to join her
father, and Cambridge would be near. There
were many secret missives passing to and fro
between the house in the woods and the Lion&#8217;s
Head, but Betty found herself too closely
watched by Spencer to dare another visit, and
by the end of a week Lord Clancarty was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
strong enough to be moved to Cambridge, to
her infinite relief. The journey was safely
and secretly accomplished, and she had the
happiness of knowing that he would have both
care and nursing, besides greater security.</p>

<p>By this time the races were over, and the
stream of people had poured back to the capital,
where Parliament had been opened by the
king, and Newmarket was empty and quiet.
Lady Sunderland went to Windsor, leaving
her daughter to go on to London to the earl&#8217;s
house, where Sunderland and Spencer had
preceded her.</p>

<p>Lady Clancarty went up to London, therefore,
with her two women, Alice and Melissa
Thurle, and tried to wait with patience for an
opportunity to see her husband again. She
was cheered and solaced, however, by frequent
secret messages that assured her, not only of
his safety, but that he was mending rapidly.
He had even been able to write her one letter
himself, which she kept hidden in her bosom
by day and under her pillow by night, though
it was only a meagre little letter, written while
his hand was still unsteady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear heart,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;was it a dream&mdash;that
lovely vision in the dark cabin? Were
those soft kisses immaterial too? Or did I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
really hold you in my arms and feel your
cheek against my own? Dear heart, dear wife,
I love you, yet am I parted from you&mdash;but
not for long&mdash;not for long! Else would
this earth be a purgatory and I should wish
the wound had been fatal! Forgive me, I do
not doubt you,&mdash;I should rather die.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the time came, at last, when it was even
dangerous to receive or send these missives, for
Lord Spencer was watchful and suspicious still,
and for Clancarty&#8217;s sake Betty forced herself
to be patient,&mdash;the sharpest trial of all.</p>

<p>The weeks passed and the cold Saint Agnes
weather was upon them. Parliament was in
the depths of its wrangles over the military
establishment, but the House of Commons,
though never more unruly than in these last
years of William the Third, was in a somewhat
milder mood&mdash;alarmed by the threatened difficulty
of the Spanish Succession&mdash;and it permitted
the ministers to put the most favorable
interpretation upon the law and retain ten
thousand fighting men. Further, it expressed
its attachment to the sovereign&#8217;s person by
suspending the benefit of the Habeas Corpus
Act twelve months longer from Bernardi and
the other conspirators involved in the late
Assassination Plot. Lord Sunderland was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
almost constantly at the king&#8217;s elbow, absorbed
in political affairs, and Spencer stood out as a
shining light among the younger Whigs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lady Clancarty fretted her heart
out because she could neither see Clancarty nor
get a message from him. Her suite of rooms
at Leicester House&mdash;which was now the town
house of the Earl of Sunderland&mdash;were never
so dreary. She paced them day and night in
her anxiety, and struggle as she would to hide
it, there were signs of it upon her face. Yet
she played her part well as the mistress of her
father&#8217;s house, and she had never been more
lovely or more courted. Her receptions were
always crowded, and at every ball she was the
centre of a lively group of admirers and friends.
But with it all her heart ached.</p>

<p>It was one evening, the night of my Lord
Bridgewater&#8217;s ball at his house in the Barbican,
that Lady Clancarty stood looking at her own
reflection, all dressed for the rout. Her gown,
a wondrous affair of silver lace and white brocade,
became her well, and her luxuriant hair
was deftly dressed with one large diamond
flashing like a star amidst the curls. She
turned away from the glass smiling&mdash;she could
not help a certain pleasure in the picture&mdash;but
the next she sighed and looked about for Alice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>&#8220;Where is the girl?&#8221; she said to herself;
&#8220;alas! what a silly fool I am to deck myself
out like this&mdash;for what? I know not, since
he cannot see me and I cannot tell how it fares
with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her mood changed swiftly; a moment before
she had thought of herself and of the ball&mdash;now
she stood dejected, her head bowed,
tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, if I only knew how he was,&#8221; she murmured
softly, &#8220;if I could only see him well!&#8221;</p>

<p>As she spoke the door opened gently and
Alice looked in, glancing around the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;What ails you, Alice?&#8221; asked her mistress,
&#8220;you wear the face of a conspirator; where
have you been?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice laid her finger on her lips and withdrew&mdash;to
Betty&#8217;s infinite astonishment&mdash;and
the next instant the door opened wider and a
tall man, cloaked and booted for riding, crossed
the threshold.</p>

<p>Betty uttered a strange little cry; her beautiful
India fan fell on the floor and broke in a
thousand pieces. Lord Clancarty sprang toward
her and caught her in his arms in time
to keep her from falling.</p>

<p>&#8220;My darling!&#8221; he said, &#8220;I came too unexpectedly&mdash;I
have done wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>&#8220;O Donough!&#8221; she cried, smiling through
her tears, &#8220;I am so glad&mdash;so glad!&#8221; and she
held him off to look at him; &#8220;pale,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and thin&mdash;but mine&mdash;mine own!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Betty darling!&#8221; he whispered, covering
her face with kisses, &#8220;I have been dying
for this&mdash;to come to you again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you came here!&#8221; she said, a little
catch in her voice, &#8220;here, in this house,&mdash;oh,
the danger of it! Spencer hates your very
name, darling; how dared you come?&#8221;</p>

<p>He caressed her soft hair, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;How dared I, Betty?&#8221; he replied, &#8220;ah,
my child, you do not know me. Are you glad
to see me even here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I glad?&#8221; she murmured, tears in her
eyes. &#8220;Ah, Donough, the days have seemed
like weeks&mdash;the weeks eternities!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not worthy of you,&#8221; he said, laying
his cheek against her soft one, &#8220;I am not
worthy of you; but above all else I love
you&mdash;ay, better than my own soul!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">MELISSA</p>


<p class="drop-cap">MEANWHILE, Alice Lynn, with a
pale face and watchful eyes, ran down
the gallery that opened into Lady
Clancarty&#8217;s private apartments; she locked the
door at the upper end and thrust the key into
her pocket; she ran back to the only other
entrance, the door upon the staircase, and there
she seated herself upon the upper step, a devoted
sentinel, though her heart beat almost
to suffocation. If Clancarty were discovered
here&mdash;here in his wife&#8217;s rooms! Alice shook
from head to foot; some awful intuition warned
her that peril was at hand.</p>

<p>The gallery was long and dim; two tall
tapers in the sconces upon the landing cast a
soft radiance in a little space, but left deep
shadows. The great house was strangely still.
Alice sat and listened to the beating of her
own heart which seemed louder than the faint
sound of voices behind the closed door at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
back. So great was her love for Lady Betty
that, like Catharine Douglas, she would have
thrust her arm into the staples and held the
door against a host, but for all that she
was frightened. Presently she started and
looked down the stairs. She had heard a soft
tread below&mdash;yes, she was not mistaken; a
woman was coming up, the one woman whom
she had thought safely out of the house that
night, the one she trusted least, Melissa
Thurle. At the moment Alice hated her, and
set her teeth and waited, but she trembled,
too. As for Melissa, she came up softly, a
quiet smile on her smooth face, serenity in her
shifting eyes; soft, stealthy, feline in every
movement. She pretended to be startled when
she stumbled upon Alice, who barred the stairs.
Melissa pressed her hand to her heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how you frightened me!&#8221; she cried;
&#8220;what is it, Alice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; retorted Alice, who was little
skilled in subterfuge and only stubbornly determined;
&#8220;I thought you were gone to your
aunt&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I started,&#8221; replied Melissa sweetly, &#8220;but
&#8217;twas too cold. I came back, and I have a
message for Lady Betty from Lord Sunderland.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>&#8220;She has a headache,&#8221; said Alice; &#8220;you
can leave the message with me; no one is to
disturb her ladyship to-night unless she calls
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, dear!&#8221; exclaimed Melissa, undisturbed,
however; &#8220;this is unusual&mdash;but, unhappily,
I must see my lady; Lord Sunderland&#8217;s
orders are explicit. I dare not disobey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do!&#8221; declared Alice stubbornly, though
she quaked, for she heard voices again and she
knew, by Melissa&#8217;s face, that she heard them,
too, for a gleam passed over it, swift as the
drawing of a knife.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are of no consequence,&#8221; said the
woman firmly; &#8220;I will see her,&#8221; and she made
a sudden spring to set the girl aside.</p>

<p>But Alice was strong, if she was not diplomatic,
and she caught her firmly by the waist.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall not see her!&#8221; she cried, her
face blazing with honest anger, &#8220;you shall not
worry her. I am stronger than you, and you
will never get past me&mdash;never!&#8221; and she
swung Melissa bodily back to the lower step.</p>

<p>At the moment, while the two eyed each
other furiously, both heard a man&#8217;s voice
behind the closed door of Lady Clancarty&#8217;s
room. Alice turned white, and Melissa
laughed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>She said not a word more. She laughed and
shrugged her shoulders, and Alice&#8217;s face
burned with shame and anger. &#8220;The hateful
wretch, the insulting, crawling creature,&#8221; the
girl thought; yet she was relieved to see her
turn and walk quietly away. At the landing,
however, she stopped and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; she said sweetly,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll not interrupt you again, Miss Prude.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she went on, while Alice burned to
run after her and box her ears. But she kept
her post, not daring to leave the door unguarded,
and after awhile, she called to Lady
Betty and warned her, but in vain; the lovers
could not part so soon. Clancarty lingered&mdash;lingered
while the precious minutes flew and
fate travelled nearer and yet nearer.</p>

<p>Once out of Alice&#8217;s sight, Melissa crept,
with her soft, catlike tread, along the lower
gallery, felt her way down a narrow stair, the
same by which Clancarty had ascended, and
looking over her shoulder occasionally to see
if the girl followed her, she opened another
door noiselessly, crept on down a long room
and through a hall. About her was every
sign of luxury and magnificence, rich soft rugs
upon the floors, long mirrors, beautiful statuary,
rare bric-a-brac from the India houses, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
evidence of culture and extravagance, and she
crept like a panther ready to spring. Her face
was like a white patch in the dusk of the
candle-light, her green eyes shone, too, like a
cat&#8217;s. On, on she crept, stealthy, determined,
venomous; a dangerous creature bent on a
miserable errand. Again, looking back for
Alice, another flight of stairs, and then a pause
before a pair of closed folding-doors. She
drew her breath and pressed her hand to her
heart. It took courage, but she had it, of
an evil sort, the courage that crawls in secret
places and strikes a man behind the back.
She opened the door gently and stood in a
sudden flood of light, looking at Lord Spencer.</p>

<p>He sat by a great candelabrum, reading
some pages of manuscript, and he did not hear
her. But having come so far, she would not
be balked; she glided nearer and began to
purr at him. The sound was scarcely human,
but he looked up quickly and bent his eyes
sternly upon her. He was so cold a man, so
pompous and important, that even this creeping
creature recoiled a little. But it was too
late now; his very glance was a command.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg pardon, my lord,&#8221; she murmured,
soft as oil, &#8220;but my love for the family&mdash;my
duty drove me here!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>&#8220;What for?&#8221; he demanded coolly, viewing
her from head to foot.</p>

<p>She was a little frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; after all she blurted it out
under those eyes of his, &#8220;there&#8217;s a man in
your sister&#8217;s rooms!&#8221;</p>

<p>He sprang from his chair with clenched hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;You damned lying cat, you!&#8221; he exclaimed,
between his teeth.</p>

<p>Melissa fell on her knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my lord,&#8221; she whined, &#8220;I did not
mean that! &#8217;Tis her husband&mdash;&#8217;tis Lord
Clancarty himself!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was as though a white mask had fallen on
his face, his figure was rigid, his eyes glittered;
rage was almost choking him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know, woman?&#8221; he asked
fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know him, sir, he has been haunting
her,&#8221; hurried on Melissa, &#8220;at Althorpe, at
Newmarket, and now here. &#8217;Twas he who
fought the duel in the meadow. They have
tried to hide it from me but they could not.
He is in her room now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Spencer glared at her, his hands twitching;
when he spoke it was hoarsely.</p>

<p>&#8220;How came he there? How came he in
this house?&#8221; he demanded.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>&#8220;Alice Lynn admitted him,&#8221; said Melissa,
glibly enough now, her eyes narrow and pale;
&#8220;and she is trying to guard the doors. You
may see her for yourself, my lord,&#8221; and she
fastened her eager gaze upon him.</p>

<p>She thought to see him take his sword and
go in search of his enemy; she had whetted
her appetite for revenge for her mistress&#8217; scorn
of her with the thought of a duel in Lady
Clancarty&#8217;s rooms, and of Clancarty in blood
at his wife&#8217;s feet, or driven out into the night&mdash;whipped!
Ah, how she licked her lips at
the thought; that would be the very acme of
triumph, and the young countess had treated
her with such contempt.</p>

<p>But Lord Spencer disappointed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Send hither Giles,&#8221; he said sharply, and
as she went out, reluctant to close the scene,
she saw him pick up his hat and cloak.</p>

<p>Wild with eagerness and curiosity, she hung
about the door; she heard some orders to
Giles, the confidential servant, and she saw
Spencer go out alone, and gasped in surprise
and disappointment. Was he afraid?</p>

<p>And Giles looked askance at her as he passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did he go?&#8221; she whispered eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the devil,&#8221; said the man sullenly,
&#8220;you&#8217;re a pretty bird, you are,&#8221; and he measured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
her with rough scorn, even while he sat
down by the main door with his pistol on his
knee.</p>

<p>Melissa wetted her lips, creeping along by
the wall opposite, watchful and feline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you to catch him here?&#8221; she demanded,
meaning Lord Clancarty.</p>

<p>The man stared at her again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I&#8217;m told to shoot him,
but steer clear, my girl, people don&#8217;t always
hit the mark,&#8221; and he grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall tell Lord Spencer!&#8221; she hissed at
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do! &#8217;tis your business,&#8221; retorted the man,
&#8220;and &#8217;twill hang you sometime, my lady-bird!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">MR. SECRETARY VERNON</p>


<p class="drop-cap2">AT the door of Leicester House Lady
Clancarty&#8217;s coach stood waiting to take
her to the ball at my Lord Bridgewater&#8217;s,
and she had quite forgotten both the
ball&mdash;which was a grand affair&mdash;and the coach.
So it was that Lord Spencer found it waiting
his convenience for a very different purpose.
He entered it at once and directed the coachman
to go to Westminster to the house of the
Under Secretary of State, and away the great,
rumbling, emblazoned coach rolled on its deadly
errand, not freighted with the charming and
vivacious countess but with a young nobleman,
whose heart swelled with passion and another
emotion, which his lordship mistook for virtue&mdash;the
virtue of the Roman who slew his
daughter.</p>

<p>As he rode through the dark streets of London
that night, a link-boy running at the horses&#8217;
heads, a tumult of strange feelings struggled in
his bosom. Passion ran high then, and party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
hatreds led men to the dagger and the sword.
The very fact that his father&#8217;s political roguery
was a byword made the young man more zealous
for his own reputation. He burned to be
a Whig of the Whigs, a shining example as a
party leader, a distinguished patriot, and now
he found sedition in his own household, a viper
in his bosom. His hatred of his Jacobite
brother-in-law ran so entirely in accord with
his political creed and his ideas of patriotism,
that he mistook it for a virtuous indignation.
He moved, therefore, with an air of righteous
displeasure, of calm dignity, when he descended
from the coach at the secretary&#8217;s door.</p>

<p>He was received with obsequious respect by
the servants and ushered up the stairs to the
private office. Mr. Secretary Vernon had entertained
friends at supper and was playing
shovel-board with his guests at the time. He
came in, therefore, in a genial mood, to urge
Lord Spencer to join them. He had every
reason to propitiate the young Whig, to soothe
and flatter a man who had already gained some
weight in Parliament. But Lord Spencer cut
short his civilities.</p>

<p>&#8220;I come on pressing business, Mr. Secretary,&#8221;
he said gravely, with a dejected air; &#8220;a
young girl&#8217;s folly can, perhaps, be excused,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
yet &#8217;tis hard to tell you that my sister&mdash;from
compassion&mdash;has received a traitor into my
father&#8217;s house;&#8221; he paused, looking solemnly
at the secretary.</p>

<p>Vernon pricked up his ears. The assassination
plot of Barclay and Bernardi and the little
band of conspirators which had thought to cut
off King William, was not yet old enough to
have lost its terrors, and the Blue Posts Tavern
was known to swarm with Jacobites, made bold&mdash;as
most Whigs believed&mdash;by William&#8217;s
lenity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your lordship distresses me,&#8221; he said
politely, as Spencer seemed to wait for him;
&#8220;may I hear more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know the story,&#8221; his lordship said
regretfully, &#8220;the foolish marriage between my
sister and the Earl of Clancarty?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vernon nodded, a sudden change coming
over his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clancarty is in London,&#8221; said Spencer,
&#8220;and my sister has received him. You can
picture my despair at such folly! Mr. Secretary,
I must have a warrant, at once, and a
guard to send the villain to the Tower.&#8221;</p>

<p>Secretary Vernon shot a look at him that a
wiser man would have called disdainful, but
Spencer was too self-absorbed to see it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>&#8220;I remember that Clancarty is excepted from
the king&#8217;s amnesty,&#8221; said the secretary thoughtfully,
&#8220;he falls under the penalties of the last
Treason Act&mdash;but your sister&mdash;can&#8217;t we
manage this more adroitly, my lord?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Spencer looked at him with sternly
virtuous anger. &#8220;Sir,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I put
my duty before all else&mdash;I desire his immediate
arrest. Delay may mean his ultimate
escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vernon bowed. &#8220;My lord,&#8221; he said, and
his lip curled scornfully, &#8220;you have truly
Roman virtue. I will fill out the warrant at
once and place it at your disposal. You desire
a guard from the Tower?&#8221; he added, as he
went to his table and began to write.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, and speedily,&#8221; replied the young
nobleman, with a sort of savage eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your lordship shall be accommodated,&#8221;
Vernon said, and touched the bell which summoned
his clerk, and to him the secretary gave
a few sharp orders. Then he turned to Lord
Spencer.</p>

<p>&#8220;This young man will accompany you, my
lord,&#8221; he said blandly, &#8220;and will give this
warrant into the hands of the proper officer,
who will go with you also, taking a sufficient
guard to effect the capture.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>Spencer thanked him. &#8220;Your zeal is commendable,
Mr. Secretary,&#8221; he said proudly,
&#8220;&#8217;tis an hour of peril to the state, and believe
me, sir, when I serve my country thus, I sacrifice
my dearest feelings at its altar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vernon bowed profoundly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; he responded, &#8220;you deserve
the plaudits of a grateful people. The misfortunes
of civil war and civil dissensions have
divided many a house against itself in this
kingdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>But after Spencer left, the secretary walked
back into the room where a party of young
men were playing shovel-board, and he told
the story with a shrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought of offering him thirty pieces
of silver,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;for his sister&#8217;s husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Zounds!&#8221; exclaimed one young gallant,
&#8220;my Lady Clancarty will be a widow&mdash;&#8217;tis an
ill wind that blows nobody good.&#8221;</p>

<p>But another guest cursed Lord Spencer
as a cowardly villain. It was Sir Edward
Mackie.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a story that it was Clancarty who
fought the duel with Lord Savile at Newmarket,&#8221;
said another; &#8220;what say you to that,
Mackie?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>But he was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jove!&#8221; exclaimed one of the secretary&#8217;s
guests, &#8220;I&#8217;ll wager ten pounds he&#8217;s gone to
warn them!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Vernon only smiled.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">THE ARREST</p>


<p class="drop-cap">IN spite of Alice&#8217;s warning, in spite of the
deadly peril that surrounded him, Clancarty
lingered at his wife&#8217;s side. It was
hard to say farewell, hard to leave her, and
though her heart was filled with misgivings and
anxieties, Lady Betty could not urge him to
go; indeed, she clung to him, weeping at the
thought of a parting that involved such perils
and hardships for him and such sorrow for her.
Moreover, there was much to talk of and to
plan. They did not mean to be separated
long; she was to go with him to the Continent
or to Ireland, and there were a thousand
details to arrange, a thousand hopes and fears
to strengthen or allay&mdash;and they were lovers,
and when did lovers ever learn to watch the
tedious hand of time?</p>

<p>The ball at Lord Bridgewater&#8217;s was forgotten,
Spencer was forgotten, all the world, in
fact, while Betty&mdash;lovely with happiness, glowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
and smiling in her splendid gown&mdash;thought
of no one but her husband, and desired no
admiration but his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my darling,&#8221; he whispered, looking
down at her as her face lay against his breast,
&#8220;can you give up all this?&#8221; he touched her
lace and jewels, &#8220;and this?&#8221; he pointed at
the luxurious room, &#8220;and all you have and
are&mdash;to follow a poor exile into poverty and
obscurity?&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled divinely.</p>

<p>&#8220;To follow my beloved even to the ends of
the earth,&#8221; she said, &#8220;&#8216;for better or for worse,
for richer or for poorer, until death do us
part,&#8217;&#8221; she murmured tenderly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Amen!&#8221; he said, and laid his face against
her soft hair, moved&mdash;how deeply she could
not know; her utter trust, her fondness touched
him to the heart. This splendid woman, with
every gift of nature and of fortune, willing to
renounce all for him&mdash;he held her close and
his eyes dimmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he said, &#8220;&#8217;tis worth living, dear
heart, for your sake! When I thought you
scorned my poverty and would rather be the
wife of Savile than mine, I cared not if I died&mdash;but
now! Ah, Betty, you could make a
dungeon paradise.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;it shall not be a dungeon,
but a home, my husband, somewhere&mdash;even
where these quarrelling kings cannot disturb
our paradise. Faith, my politics grow
strangely mixed,&#8221; she added, with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Love knows no politics,&#8221; he answered,
smiling too, &#8220;you and I shall not quarrel over
our principles, sweetheart.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, the door was thrown open and
Alice ran into the room with a ghastly face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my lady,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;there&#8217;s something
wrong&mdash;I hear strange voices below, there are
men upon the stairs! My lord must hide.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;Donough, there is the
other door!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis useless,&#8221; cried Alice; &#8220;they come
from both sides&mdash;I saw them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will hide you!&#8221; Betty cried wildly,
catching her husband&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>For an instant he hesitated; he, too, heard
the heavy feet in the gallery, then he shook
his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Betty, dear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I cannot be
hunted like a rat in a hole; I must face them
like a man, like your husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>She uttered a little cry of despair and clung
to him, while Alice wrung her hands.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, the window, my lord!&#8221; she cried,
&#8220;there is a balcony!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too late, my girl,&#8221; Lord Clancarty replied
calmly, the light flashing in his gray eyes, his
head erect; &#8220;no, no, I&#8217;ve never let an enemy
see my back&mdash;I can&#8217;t learn to run now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty looked up at him and caught her
breath; here was a man after her own heart.
She felt his hand go to his sword and she, too,
looked toward the door. They had not even
thought of barring it, but it would have been
useless, for it was thrown wide open by a
sheriff&#8217;s deputy, who was followed by a guard
of stout yeomen from the Tower.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Donough Macarthy, Earl of Clancarty,
here?&#8221; demanded the sheriff, fixing his eyes
on the earl as he stood there, with his wife
clinging to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Clancarty,&#8221; he replied proudly. Resistance
would have been worse than useless,
and he only pressed his dear Betty closer to
his heart; he knew that separation was inevitable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a warrant to seize the body of the
Earl of Clancarty and carry him to the Tower,
on the charge of high treason,&#8221; said the officer,
producing the parchment and reading the warrant
aloud in the king&#8217;s name.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>&#8220;I do not acknowledge the authority of the
Prince of Orange,&#8221; said Clancarty calmly, &#8220;but
I must submit to superior numbers,&#8221; he
added, with a scornful glance at the six stout
yeomen who had filed into the room and stood
gaping at Lady Clancarty. &#8220;You have arrested
me in the apartments of my wife. I
came to London solely to see the Countess of
Clancarty, but I will go with you without
further protest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer bowed to Lady Clancarty.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am reluctant to part you, my lord,&#8221; he
said grimly, &#8220;but we have no time to lose; my
orders are explicit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might find a better office, sir,&#8221; said
Lady Betty, withering him with a look, and
then breaking down when her husband kissed
her farewell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have comfort, dear heart,&#8221; he whispered,
though he knew the case was desperate; &#8220;bear
up for my sake&mdash;now!&#8221;</p>

<p>But she clung to him in a passion of grief,
begging to go with him to the Tower until it
wrung his heart anew to leave her. Even the
soldiers glanced away in grim silence, and she
was half unconscious when Clancarty unclasped
her hands from his neck and laid her in Alice&#8217;s
arms.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>&#8220;Care for her, Alice,&#8221; he said, in a tone of
deep but restrained emotion, &#8220;guard her
tenderly, do not leave her in this hour of trial&mdash;for
they will tear me from her! My poor
darling&mdash;my poor wife!&#8221;</p>

<p>He lingered to kiss her again, to push the
soft hair back from her forehead, and it was
only a final order from the sheriff that took
him from her side.</p>

<p>The guards had escorted him out at last, or
rather he had walked out proudly with them,
though his heart was aching for her. They
were already at the lower door when Lady
Clancarty, recovering consciousness, sprang up
to come face to face with Spencer. Then the
truth flashed upon her and she stood before
him with a terrible face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you betrayed him!&#8221; she cried,
&#8220;you sent those men here to drag him
away!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Spencer took it as a compliment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; he said piously; &#8220;I delivered the
traitor to his fate; I would do it were he my
own flesh and blood. No sacrifice is too great
for truth and justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hypocrite!&#8221; cried Lady Betty passionately;
&#8220;you have broken your sister&#8217;s
heart for the sake of your pride&mdash;your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
politics! You have murdered my husband&mdash;my
husband!&#8221; she wrung her hands in
agony.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done my duty,&#8221; he replied coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your duty?&#8221; she cried bitterly; &#8220;was it
then your duty to betray your sister&#8217;s husband?
To force an officer and his guard into your
sister&#8217;s rooms&mdash;to trample on her tenderest
feelings&mdash;to mortify and crush her? Duty!&#8221;
she repeated scornfully, &#8220;then may no man
henceforth do his duty! Such virtue is more
vile than vice&mdash;such courage worse than cowardice!
How dare you face me or look at
me? An injured woman! I mark your white
face, sir, and I marvel at its pallor; it should
burn with shame.&#8221;</p>

<p>Spencer ground his teeth in anger. &#8220;You
saucy minx,&#8221; he said, &#8220;how dared you have
that man here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dared I?&#8221; she repeated, &#8220;how dared
I have my husband with me? Whom should
I have with me if not my husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused for breath; her bosom rose and
fell, she put her hands to her throat as if she
choked. It was a moment before she could
speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you done?&#8221; she went on passionately,
her slender figure towering, her eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
on fire; &#8220;you have torn him from my arms,
you have sent him to his death, but you
cannot tear him from my heart! While that
beats, while the blood runs through these
veins, I will love him&mdash;love him! And he
is my husband&mdash;my husband, do you hear,
you coward? I bear his name, I am his, his
flesh and blood, his very own&mdash;you cannot
separate us! Even if you kill him, our souls
are one; you cannot part them any more than
you can rend the sky asunder! I am not your
sister&mdash;I am Clancarty&#8217;s wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shame on you, madam,&#8221; said Spencer
bitterly, his face like ashes, gray and white;
&#8220;shame on you to declare yourself so passionately
enamoured of a Jacobite&mdash;a reprobate&mdash;a&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of my husband,&#8221; she said, and her low
voice cut like a lash.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your husband,&#8221; he mocked; &#8220;are you sure
that he is your lawful husband? A sneaking
rogue who crept to your room by a back-stair&mdash;who
would not face your family like a man
of honor!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What insult more have you for me?&#8221; she
cried; &#8220;&#8217;tis you who dared not face him; you
crept behind him like a coward, you&mdash;you
Judas!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>She caught her breath, her hands at her
throat again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, madam,&#8221; said his lordship coldly;
&#8220;your fury suffocates you. It will not avail,&#8221;
he laughed, &#8220;to set the rogue free!&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him strangely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you human?&#8221; she asked, &#8220;are you
like other men?&mdash;or some monster, some
abortive creature, cast upon the earth to wreck
the lives of others? How could any woman
marry you? I think you are not human&mdash;though
we are of the same mother!&#8221;</p>

<p>Spencer laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite human, Elizabeth,&#8221; he said sneering,
&#8220;as human as my termagant sister&mdash;as the
rogue they are carrying now to the Tower,
where, I trust, he&#8217;ll rest well&mdash;and safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>She recoiled half way across the room and
stared at him wildly, as if her very senses were
bewildered.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the Tower?&#8221; she repeated, like a child
who had a lesson by rote, &#8220;the great gloomy
Tower yonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you have preferred Newgate?&#8221; my
lord asked maliciously, beginning to find some
joy in a situation that had not been without
humiliation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>&#8220;They carry my husband to the Tower!&#8221;
Lady Betty cried wildly, clasping her hands to
her bosom as if to still the tumult there, &#8220;and
I stand here talking to the Judas who betrayed
him! Go hang yourself, my lord,&mdash;surely
you cannot want to live,&#8221; she went on,
mad with her despair; &#8220;let me see your face
no more. The very air you breathe poisons
me. Never, never shall the same roof shelter
us again! I go, sir, your sister no longer,
but the beggar&#8217;s wife. I go to share his fate,
to starve with him, to die for him or with him!
But to see you no more forever and forever!&#8221;</p>

<p>She rushed past him, sweeping her skirts
aside that they might not so much as touch
him, and ran wildly out of the room.</p>

<p>Fleeing through the long galleries and down
the stairs, in her splendid dress, and heedless
of the gaping servants and of the bitter cold
she went out, bareheaded, into the night.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">POOR Lady Betty, half distracted, fled
from the house into Leicester Fields,
trying to find the party that had preceded
her with her husband as a prisoner.
The darkness and the peril of the London
streets at that late hour did not enter her
thoughts. Bareheaded and without a cloak
to shield her from the cold night air, she ran
around the square.</p>

<p>She saw lights in the adjacent houses, she
heard voices in the distance, but she only
looked for one&mdash;her husband. She took no
thought of the madness of her project; she
sped on and on, and might have come into
some great peril had she not fallen almost into
the arms of a man who was running toward
Lord Sunderland&#8217;s mansion. They came upon
each other in the darkness; in her grief and
nervousness she uttered a little cry, and he
knew her voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>&#8220;Lady Clancarty!&#8221; he exclaimed, stopping
short.</p>

<p>It was young Mackie.</p>

<p>At first she did not recognize him, but when
she did, she caught his arm with a frantic
appeal. The light from a dim lantern overhead
shone on her white face.</p>

<p>&#8220;My husband!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;my Lord
Clancarty. They have dragged him away to
prison. My&mdash;nay, I will not call him my
brother&mdash;that man yonder, Charles Spencer,
betrayed him&mdash;betrayed my husband, and they
came into my very rooms to arrest him&mdash;to
tear us apart, and he has gone,&#8221; she added
wildly, &#8220;gone to the Tower.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; he replied, deeply moved, &#8220;I
know. I was at Vernon&#8217;s house and heard
it after your&mdash;after Lord Spencer got the
warrant. I came to warn you but, alas, I am
too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, too late!&#8221; cried Betty, a little wildly,
&#8220;too late; but I am going to the Tower&mdash;I
am going to my husband!&#8221;</p>

<p>They had walked on a little way as they
talked, and were so near Aylesbury House
that the lights from within fell on her. He
saw her uncovered head and dazzling gown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Clancarty,&#8221; he said persuasively, &#8220;let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
us go back for your cloak and mask. You
can&#8217;t go down the river to the Tower thus&mdash;in
the cold!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I care not for it,&#8221; she replied; &#8220;go back?&#8221;
she shuddered, &#8220;I could not&mdash;I cannot breathe
the same air with Spencer, it poisons me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Without another word young Mackie took
off his own cloak and wrapped it around her,
and she, in her excitement, took no thought of
his exposure to the cold in his thin suit of
velvet and satin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go!&#8221; she reiterated, &#8220;the very
shortest way&mdash;I must go to my husband!&#8221;
and her voice broke pitifully.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall go, dear Lady Clancarty,&#8221; he
said gently, setting himself to face the task,
though a sharp pain rankled in his own bosom,
and when he drew her hand through his arm
he set his teeth.</p>

<p>He loved her, too, and she took no more
thought of him than of a stone&mdash;such is the
way of women.</p>

<p>The night wind cut their faces as they walked
toward the river. She was so used to service
from men, to their devotion, that she took his
for granted; she did not even try to talk to
him, but he heard her weeping softly and the
pitiful little sound made him shiver. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
longed to comfort her, but he set his teeth
harder&mdash;he knew she wept for Lord Clancarty.</p>

<p>When they reached the water stairs she was
resolute again and alert. She walked unassisted
down the steps and urged him to take
any boat for the Tower, impatient of the
wrangling of the boatmen. She stamped her
foot at them, in fact, and took so high a tone
that, at last, the blackguards subsided and took
them meekly enough, though the order, &#8220;the
Traitor&#8217;s Gate,&#8221; caused some murmurs.</p>

<p>Once on the water she sat erect and silent,
straining eyes and ears for the king&#8217;s boat,
which had, of course, preceded hers, with her
husband aboard. She hoped to be close enough
behind to gain admission with him; she had
no other hope, no other prayer but to share
his fate, however wretched, to follow him to
prison and to death. Her impulsive nature
stirred at last to its depths swept her on. She
could be as heroic now and as resolute as she
had been careless and happy in the summer
time of her life. She was imperial woman to
her finger tips; she loved and hated with the
full, fierce tide of her rich nature. She gave all
and kept nothing back.</p>

<p>Young Mackie looking at the dark outline
of her figure against the gray river, felt all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
keenly and admired her the more. She was
a woman to die for, he thought, and turned his
boyish face away, for he dared not look at her&mdash;it
tried him too far.</p>

<p>Something in her mood seemed to cast a
spell upon the boatmen; the wherry swept on
in silence, save for the sound of the oars and
the ripple of water under its bow. The lights
of the city, feeble lanterns swung across the
narrow, reeking streets, gleamed dimly; the
river was as still as death.</p>

<p>At last the frowning bastions of the Tower&mdash;that
inexorable fortress, dark with secrets,
grim as Fate,&mdash;cast their black shadow over
them. And then,&mdash;Betty&#8217;s heart stood still&mdash;the
boat turned and began to creep under the
vaulted arch at the Traitor&#8217;s Gate. The faint
gleaming of night upon the waters narrowed
behind them and was swallowed up in darkness,
while before, the red lights at the gate
began to shine. The boat jarred on the steps.
She looked up and saw the closed wicket and
the guard of yeomen looking down, and
suddenly despair seized upon her and she
trembled so that Mackie had almost to lift her
from the boat.</p>

<p>Then arose the question of admittance. She
wished to see the warden; but Sir Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
knew this was no easy matter and resorted to
a stratagem.</p>

<p>&#8220;We come from Mr. Secretary Vernon,&#8221;
he said boldly, with an air of authority.</p>

<p>The sergeant at the gate hesitated, and asked
for a permit.</p>

<p>&#8220;The matter is pressing,&#8221; Mackie said
firmly; &#8220;we must be admitted.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant shook his head, looking gravely
out upon them. A yeoman lifted his torch
and the light streamed on Lady Betty&#8217;s beautiful
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot admit you at this hour,&#8221; the old
soldier replied firmly but not unkindly; &#8220;my
orders are explicit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty&#8217;s face changed and seemed to shrink
into childish proportions; she held out her
hands pitifully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg you,&#8221; she said, her voice quivering,
&#8220;I am Lady Clancarty, the wife of the earl
who has just been arrested. Is he here? I
pray you tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men at the wicket exchanged significant
glances, and the elder looked down at
her again in open pity.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was committed about twenty minutes
ago, madam,&#8221; he replied kindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty minutes? O Sir Edward, twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
minutes ago, and I might have seen him!&#8221;
and she wept bitterly.</p>

<p>She drew a ring from her finger, a costly
jewel, and pressed it upon the soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;I pray you let me enter too!&#8221; she cried,
&#8220;I would only share his prison. See, I have no
weapons&mdash;nothing! I cannot set him free&mdash;I
only want to share his fate!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant waved aside her jewel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; he said firmly, &#8220;bribes I may not
take. Truly, madam, if I could let you see
your husband I would do it, but I dare not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mackie urged him then, using the name of
the Duke of Devonshire, though he had felt
from the first that without a permit she could
never be admitted. Lady Clancarty would not
give way so readily; she struggled with her
grief and commanded her voice again, going
closer to the wicket and laying her hands upon
it&mdash;that famous wicket which had closed behind
so many prisoners; on Anne Boleyn and
Lady Jane Grey, on Sir Thomas More and
Cranmer and on the Duke of Norfolk; the
wicket stained with a long history of terror and
despair&mdash;was clasped now by Lady Betty&#8217;s
slender fingers, and she prayed for admittance&mdash;a
new prayer, indeed, at the Traitor&#8217;s Gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will let me in,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
speak with the captain of the guard! I am the
daughter of the Earl of Sunderland. I demand
this much&mdash;to see the captain of the guard.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the man gave way a little; he sent
a yeoman for the captain of the watch, but he
kept the wicket closed and stood grim and
silent, looking out upon them. The torchlight
flared up and down, the water rippled below
them on the stone steps&mdash;it seemed like
the tongue of a hungry wolf lapping blood&mdash;and
there was silence.</p>

<p>At last came the echo of heavy feet upon
the stone floor, the rattle of arms, and the tall,
gray-headed captain came to the wicket and
looked out, inexorable as fate, though his eyes
changed a little at the sight of Lady Clancarty,
common as a woman&#8217;s grief was there. He
listened to Mackie&#8217;s explanation, gravely respectful
but unrelenting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ask only to see him&mdash;to share his fate,&#8221;
Betty said, as Sir Edward concluded, &#8220;&#8217;tis so
little!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the officer shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, madam,&#8221; he replied kindly, &#8220;not
without the king&#8217;s orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At least permit her to see her husband, to
speak with him,&#8221; urged Sir Edward.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a small thing to grant me,&#8221; cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
Betty, &#8220;I pray you, sir, think of your own
wife in a like case, and show compassion on the
unfortunate!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, madam, I need no urging,&#8221; said the
captain, &#8220;if it were in my power&mdash;but it is
not; since the last assassination plot we have
been strictly enjoined to guard our prisoners
of state and hedge them in with every precaution.
Your case is in higher hands than mine.
Surely, Lady Clancarty, you can obtain influence
enough to grant your wish,&mdash;your father,
Secretary Vernon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father,&#8221; Lady Clancarty repeated bitterly,
as she stood thinking, her white face
downcast.</p>

<p>The two men exchanged significant glances;
neither of them had hope. Clancarty was
scarcely an object for the king&#8217;s clemency; he
was a notorious Jacobite, a man of daring,
whose personal prominence as an Irish earl, no
less than his political affiliations, marked him
out for probable example.</p>

<p>Happily, she did not see their looks, she
stood leaning against the wicket, her head bent.
She looked up and began to plead again to see
her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may put me behind bolts and bars,&#8221;
she said passionately, &#8220;I care not; indeed, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
pray to be a prisoner too, since he is one. Ah,
it is so little that I ask. What could I do?
I could not break his chains&mdash;I could not set
him free! I only pray&mdash;pray you,&#8221; she
stretched out her hands in fervent supplication,
&#8220;to let me share his prison! I cannot be free
while he is here&mdash;I will not be free!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old soldier shook his head, he was
deeply touched.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot, madam,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;but let
me beg you to carry this petition to one who
can and will surely hear you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean the king?&#8221; said Mackie.</p>

<p>The officer inclined his head. &#8220;I know of
no one in these three kingdoms so merciful,&#8221;
he replied quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a wise thought,&#8221; said Sir Edward
gently, as if he spoke to a child; &#8220;come, Lady
Clancarty, let us carry our petition to his
majesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the moment she had completely broken
down. She wept and her sobs shook her from
head to foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot leave him here,&#8221; she cried; &#8220;how
dare you ask me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Mackie bowed his head; he, too,
was shaken by her emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only beg of you to appeal to one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
has the power to grant your petition,&#8221; he said,
very low.</p>

<p>It was a little while yet before she conquered
herself and looked up through her tears at
them both.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you mean kindly to me,&#8221; she
said, with a humility strangely touching in one
of her high spirit; &#8220;I will go to my father,
Sir Edward, he may hear me&mdash;but I have
little hope&mdash;so little hope!&#8221; and she fell to
weeping again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">ALICE AND DENIS</p>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Lady Clancarty fled wildly
from her father&#8217;s house, poor Alice
was too much overwhelmed with the
agony of the recent scene to know what to do.
For the moment she gave way only to her
grief, fleeing from Spencer and from the woman,
Melissa, as she would have fled from pestilence.
But she was too sensible and too faithful to
remain long without making an effort to follow
her mistress. In less than an hour, therefore,
she had gathered up a heavy cloak and hood
of Lady Betty&#8217;s, and assuming her own mantle,
went out into the night. It took no small
courage to do this, when the streets of London
were beset by rogues of every class and description,
and the dim streaks of light from an occasional
lantern swung in some archway served
only to make the darkness visible. Alice,
who was urged on by no frenzy like Lady
Clancarty&#8217;s, went out with a sinking heart, her
sharp sense of duty alone keeping her to her
purpose. She had not dared to ask even a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
lackey from the house to attend her; these
town servants were strangers to her, and everywhere
she looked for treachery. Poor Alice
wrapped her cloak around her and set out
alone upon a devious course of wanderings,
through every lane and byway in the vicinity,
in a fruitless quest for her dear lady. Sometimes
the girl proceeded quietly through a
deserted street; again she shrank into the
shelter of a friendly doorway at the sound of
high voices and drunken laughter; and again&mdash;and
more than once&mdash;she dodged some
ruffian who would have pounced upon her,
and fled, saved by swift running, for she was
fleet as any deer. The terrors of the night
grew upon her until her knees shook under
her. She could not imagine what evil had
befallen her lovely and unhappy mistress and
more than once she stopped, blinded by tears.</p>

<p>Just as her despair reached a climax, she
came in sight of the Standard Tavern and
glanced at it timidly; even at that hour it was
well lighted and full of company. As she
watched, a figure came out of the door and
stood by the lantern under the sign&mdash;a short,
sturdy figure and a homely Irish face. She
recognized Denis, and Denis was Lord Clancarty&#8217;s
faithful servant. She did not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
that he had only just discovered the arrest of
his master in Sunderland&#8217;s house and had put
his own interpretation upon it. She rushed
blindly&mdash;as we do&mdash;upon fate.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Mr. Denis!&#8221; she cried, revealing her
white face under her hood, &#8220;have you seen my
mistress? my dear Lady Clancarty?&#8221;</p>

<p>Denis wheeled and eyed her with an expression
that she did not understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Begorra!&#8221; he ejaculated, beneath his breath,
and swept down upon her like an avalanche.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know ye, me darlint,&#8221; he said, and there
was something in his tone that sent a shiver
through Alice, &#8220;ye&#8217;ll walk a stip with me an&#8217;
tell me thrue all ye know of this, ivery wurd!
Come on, mavourneen, &#8217;tis fer me ear alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go with you,&#8221; Alice said, trying to
pull away from him, but his grip was a vise;
&#8220;my poor lady is out here in the night&mdash;I must
find her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A curse upon her!&#8221; said Denis fiercely,
&#8220;a curse upon her smilin&#8217;, desateful face; may
she dhry up an&#8217; wither away loike a did leaf&mdash;an&#8217;
may&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice cried out a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me go!&#8221; she said, &#8220;you bloody Irishman,
let me go. I thought you were a faithful
servant to Lord Clancarty.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not let ye go,&#8221; retorted Denis savagely,
dragging her along, &#8220;I&#8217;ll not let ye go until I
make yer teeth rattle!&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice screamed aloud in an agony of fright;
but of what avail was it? A woman&#8217;s scream
in the black mouth of a London lane at midnight;
it was only a drop upon the surface of
a black pool.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scrame away, ye little threacherous, spiteful
cat, ye!&#8221; said Denis, shaking her fiercely;
&#8220;ye&#8217;d bethray me masther, would ye? Begorra,
I&#8217;d loike ter kill ye intirely! Take
that, ye hizzy!&#8221; and he gave her a sound blow
that made the poor girl reel.</p>

<p>Alice was no weakling and she put out all
her strength and fought him, screaming.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ye cat, ye!&#8221; he said harshly, shaking
her again; &#8220;take that&mdash;an&#8217; that, ye lyin&#8217;, desateful
hizzy! I&#8217;ll teach ye,&#8221; and he shook her
much as a big dog shakes a kitten.</p>

<p>Alice screamed; if she even dimly conceived
his error, she had no breath to argue
with him; she believed, indeed, that her last
hour had come, and shrieked with all her
strength. And Denis shook her, and would
have gone on shaking her indefinitely but for
a timely interruption.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">FATHER AND DAUGHTER</p>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Lady Clancarty ascended the
water stairs on her return from the
Tower she was outwardly calm,
the floodtide of her emotion having spent itself
in the outburst at the Traitor&#8217;s Gate.
Young Mackie, still acting as her sole escort,
came up the steps behind her and the two,
pausing at the top, saw dawn breaking over
the river. Like a wraith the fog rolled up
along the water, the sky grew pale and in the
far east a light shone, keen and cold. The
streets were unusually quiet; it was a little
before the hour when a city stirs for its first
breath; darkness lay deeply in the narrow
lanes, and silence. On the river, which
bristled with a forest of masts, some ships put
up their sails.</p>

<p>Suddenly they heard a woman&#8217;s scream and
saw two figures struggling at the mouth of the
lane before them. Mackie started toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
them, but the woman broke away and ran
screaming to the water side, almost brushing
against Lady Clancarty, and as she did so
there was a cry of recognition and she fell
upon her neck, weeping and exclaiming. It
was Alice Lynn. Sir Edward seized the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;You rogue!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;you would
abuse a woman, would you?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the fellow, struggling lustily for his
liberty, broke out with an Irish oath, and
Mackie knew him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are Lord Clancarty&#8217;s man,&#8221; he said
in surprise, releasing him; &#8220;what means this?
I am Sir Edward Mackie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Faix, there&#8217;s naything the matther,&#8221; replied
Denis sullenly, rubbing his neck; &#8220;I was
jist givin&#8217; thet dasignin&#8217; hizzy a shaking fer
bethrayin&#8217; me Lord Clancarty&mdash;curse her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are mistaken, my man,&#8221; said Mackie,
understanding Denis&#8217;s error, &#8220;I was at Secretary
Vernon&#8217;s when Lord Spencer came in
for the warrant. Lady Clancarty has just
come from the Tower where she would fain
have shared your master&#8217;s imprisonment. Her
woman here, I doubt not, is as faithful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The saints be praised!&#8221; exclaimed Denis
piously, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t b&#8217;lave ill of her ladyship,
but whin there&#8217;s snake wurrk loike this, yer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
honor, I&#8217;m afther looking fer th&#8217; woman;
&#8217;twas a woman, sir, that started in these
dalings with th&#8217; ould serpent himself. Me
lord&#8217;s as good as did now,&mdash;woe&#8217;s me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say nothing like that to my lady, I charge
you,&#8221; said Mackie sharply, &#8220;she cannot bear
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the moment, Betty called Denis, having
heard Alice&#8217;s story and divining his mistake.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will forgive you, Denis,&#8221; she said, &#8220;since
it was for my lord&#8217;s sake; but you have nearly
killed my poor girl with fright and she was
only seeking me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, your ladyship,&#8221; he said humbly,
&#8220;I can but die fer ye, me poor lord&mdash;&#8221;
he broke down, and Lady Clancarty said no
more; she, too, was overcome.</p>

<p>It did not occur to Denis to apologize to
the victim of his mistaken vengeance, but
when he learned that Lady Clancarty intended
to make another attempt to get into the
Tower, he joined himself to her party, without
asking permission, and followed on, determined
to go with her to his master, ignoring Alice&#8217;s
abhorrence.</p>

<p>It was with this strangely assorted company
that Lady Clancarty returned at daybreak to
her father&#8217;s house. Not to remain, as she told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
young Mackie, for never again would she
dwell under the same roof with the man who
had betrayed her husband.</p>

<p>The events of the night, quite as exciting at
home as abroad, had made the Earl of Sunderland
wakeful, so it happened that he was out
of bed when his daughter sought him in his
own room. She found him, clad in a great
shag gown, sitting in an armchair by the fire,
calmly sipping a cup of chocolate, his bland
countenance showing no sign of perturbation,
no matter what his emotions might have been.
Nor did he express any surprise at his daughter&#8217;s
appearance in her strange guise at that
unusual hour. He smiled upon her quite
benignly and waved her toward a chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;A cup of chocolate, my love,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;you look fatigued.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty looked at him sadly. She knew only
too well how hard it was to touch his heart
under that polished exterior, if heart he had at
all, and she had often doubted it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not sit down?&#8221; he asked with
apparent surprise; &#8220;you must be tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not wish to rest here,&#8221; she replied
sadly, &#8220;I cannot under the same roof with
Spencer,&#8221;&mdash;she would not call him her
brother; &#8220;I know you have heard all, sir,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
she added, watching him keenly&mdash;hoping,
fearing; &#8220;I have come here to pray your
good offices with the king&mdash;to ask you to
help your own daughter to save her husband
from death!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Sunderland held up his hand deprecatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My love,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I feared as much!
Pray do not ask the impossible! You know how
they hate me in Parliament because I am supposed
to have the king&#8217;s ear. If I meddle in
this they will bring in a bill of attainder,&mdash;it is
a favorite scheme of theirs,&#8221; he added bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, father, they will kill my husband,&#8221;
cried Betty, &#8220;they will behead him for high
treason, and he only came here to see
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Sunderland smiled and sipped his chocolate,
quite unmoved.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a traitor, though, my dear,&#8221; he
remarked, &#8220;and quite a notorious one. My
dear Betty, don&#8217;t make a scene&mdash;you know
nothing about the man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is my husband,&#8221; she cried with passionate
grief, &#8220;is that no tie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known several fine ladies who did not
consider it one,&#8221; replied the earl, with a titter,
&#8220;notably my Lady Shrewsbury the elder.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>&#8220;An infamous creature, and you know it!&#8221;
cried Betty, with something of her old spirit,
and then she threw herself on her knees beside
him; &#8220;father, father,&#8221; she pleaded, &#8220;you were
ever kind to me&mdash;oh, pity me, help me to save
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sunderland tried to raise her; he even caressed
her bowed head. He detested a scene,
and he did not know how to manage this
beautiful young creature.</p>

<p>&#8220;My child,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this will pass; you do
not know him well enough to feel his loss. The
marriage was my folly; your release&mdash;though
doubtless painful and cruel&mdash;will be a blessing
in disguise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty recoiled from his touch, her face white.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love him,&#8221; she declared simply, &#8220;his
death upon the block would kill me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut!&#8221; replied her father heartlessly;
&#8220;we young people always die so easily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather die than find those of my
own blood so indifferent to my wretchedness,&#8221;
cried Betty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are indifferent, too,&#8221; rejoined
the earl; &#8220;your mother lies ill now at Windsor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; Betty said, &#8220;but I must try
to save my husband. Father, father!&#8221; she
clung to his hand weeping, &#8220;if you ever loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
me&mdash;as an infant, as a child, as a young girl,&mdash;do
not abandon me now. Oh, help me to
save him! Do you not remember when you
used to carry me in your arms&mdash;your little girl?
Oh, you were kind to me, father, kinder than any
one else! You will not break my heart now?
My mother never cared for me as you did&mdash;never
caressed me so, never brought me toys.
I loved you then, sir, and I love you now.
Have you no place in your heart for me&mdash;your
daughter, your little girl, Elizabeth?
Go to the king&mdash;you have but to ask; they
say he is merciful, and he trusts you. Oh, save
Donough!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Sunderland sighed. &#8220;My dear,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;I would gladly help you, but you ask
the impossible. I have no power to save a
traitor. You know as well as I that even the
Habeas Corpus Act is suspended on account
of that rogue Bernardi and his accomplices;
you know the story of the Fenwick attainder.
How can you ask me to risk my head and my
family reputation for this Irishman? You
fancy you love him, Betty, but &#8217;tis only
your fancy. There are other men as brave,&#8221;
he added, with a smile; &#8220;you need not be a
widow long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty sprang to her feet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>&#8220;You, too, insult me&mdash;and you are my
father. Oh, I have no father, then, any more&mdash;the
old, dear memories are but dreams&mdash;the
hand that caressed my childish head can deal
me such a blow as this! Ah, it breaks my
heart! Alas, there is no earthly hope!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Sunderland poured out another cup of
chocolate.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied calmly, &#8220;not for Clancarty.
Really, my dear, I must be firm, I cannot and
I will not risk my reputation, perhaps my life,
for&mdash;&#8221; he shrugged his shoulders, &#8220;a Jacobite
rogue.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said nothing, but she gave him a look so
eloquent that he shrank a little, with all his
effrontery, as she turned to leave the room.
At the door she paused and waved her hand to
him with a gesture of infinite sadness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Farewell, father,&#8221; she said softly, &#8220;farewell!
I loved you&mdash;I love you still&mdash;and I forgive
you&mdash;as I pray to be forgiven. I go, your
daughter no longer&mdash;since you disown Clancarty&#8217;s
wife. I have no home, no father&mdash;only
my husband! Farewell, farewell!&#8221;</p>

<p>He heard the low sound of her weeping as
she went out, her head bowed and her whole
beautiful young figure full of dejection. She
felt herself an outcast.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">MY LORD OF DEVONSHIRE</p>


<p class="drop-cap2">LADY BETTY&#8217;S weakness passed. She
was too strong, too loving, and too
determined by nature, to give way to
the tears and sighs of a whining woman. So
stern was her face and so resolute that even
Alice, with all the old claims of faithful service
and affection, dared not offer her any consolation
save to kiss her hand humbly and sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Alice,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I cannot talk to
you. When I was happy I chattered like a
magpie; but now that I feel so much I am
tongue-tied; yet I understand, my girl, I
understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could help you,&#8221; Alice said, in
tears, &#8220;I wish I could do something for you
both!&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty shook her head sadly. &#8220;There is no
one but the king. Ah, Alice, in my careless
days I have mocked his Dutch accent and his
Dutch ways&mdash;but now&mdash;I go to him as my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
one hope under heaven! How foolish I have
been, how heartless!&#8221;</p>

<p>She would not stay in Leicester House; she
only lingered long enough to select her plainest
gown and a cloak and hood, and to take such
jewels and money as belonged to her individually,
before she and Alice set out, attended by
the tireless Sir Edward. Not this time to the
Tower, however, but to a mediator who might
approach the king with more likelihood of
success than any one; the widow of the
martyred Lord Russell. From Sir Edward
Mackie, Lady Russell learned that morning
the whole story, and her heart was touched by
the despair of the young countess, suffering as
she had suffered. Though of all women Lady
Russell was the last one to sympathize with a
Jacobite, yet her compassion moved her to forgive
her enemies, and from her Lady Clancarty
might look for more help than from any
one, for she was an honored and revered friend
of King William&#8217;s.</p>

<p>So to Lady Russell&#8217;s house in Bloomsbury
the young Countess of Clancarty directed her
steps, and it was on the way thither that they
met the coach of my Lord of Devonshire.
The great emblazoned coach drawn by four
stout Flanders mares, with outriders in crimson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
and gold lace, came clattering and rumbling
along the street, the men cursing and shouting
at the other vehicles that threatened to stop
his grace&#8217;s way. Betty and her escort stood
back to escape the mud from the kennel as it
passed.</p>

<p>The news of Spencer&#8217;s despicable act and of
Clancarty&#8217;s arrest had been spread over the
town by the young men at Secretary Vernon&#8217;s
dinner. When his grace saw Lady Clancarty
afoot at that early hour, therefore, he ordered
his coach to stop and descended with great
dignity.</p>

<p>She did not wait for him to speak, running
up to him with an eager face.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord, my lord,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I claim
your promise at Newmarket. You will help
me save my Lord Clancarty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Devonshire gracefully kissed her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Lady Clancarty,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I
would hesitate only at John the Baptist&#8217;s head
upon a charger! I shall keep my promise.
Indeed, &#8217;tis partly kept already, for I have
just arranged with my Lords of Ormond and
Bedford to go with me to Kensington for your
sake. But,&#8221; the great man paused, glancing
at the beautiful face, &#8220;my dear child, you
would be the best suppliant,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>&#8220;I will go,&#8221; Betty answered, &#8220;though, indeed,
my lord, I do not know how the king will
receive me&mdash;he is so cold! And my father&mdash;&#8221;
her voice broke at the word; &#8220;Lord Sunderland
will not help me. Sir Edward has suggested
Lady Russell as an intercessor.&#8221;</p>

<p>An expression of surprise passed over
Devonshire&#8217;s face, but it brightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know of no one better,&#8221; he said gravely;
&#8220;nay, dear Lady Clancarty, take heart of
grace; your cold king is a merciful one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty drew a sharp breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;My Lord Clancarty is out of his clemency,&#8221;
she said faintly; &#8220;the Habeas Corpus Act&mdash;&#8221;
she could say no more.</p>

<p>Devonshire looked grave and his eyes
met Mackie&#8217;s significantly, but he took her
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;My child,&#8221; he said kindly, &#8220;you will go
in my carriage to Lady Russell&#8217;s and then I
will go to Kensington; we will not surrender
until we are beaten. You are not wont to be
faint hearted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am changed,&#8221; she replied; &#8220;the old
Betty is quite dead, I think, my lord; now
I am only the shadow of Clancarty; as he
suffers so also do I. If I could but see
him!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>&#8220;I have sent to the Tower,&#8221; said the duke
reassuringly, &#8220;and I think I may get a letter
for you. Would a word be any comfort?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my lord!&#8221; she exclaimed, and kissed
his hand impulsively.</p>

<p>Once in the coach they travelled rapidly;
the duke talking of other things, seeing well
enough that her strength was overtaxed. He
was still talking when the carriage turned from
Little Queen Street and stopped in Bloomsbury
Square. He led her by the hand into the
presence of Rachel, Lady Russell, his kinswoman
by marriage, and Lady Betty never
forgot the benevolence of the great man&#8217;s face,
the kindly pressure of his hand, the fatherly
interest of his glance, as he walked beside her
in the splendid dress he had assumed to go to
court. Nor did she forget the sad, sweet dignity
of the widow who rose to meet them and
came forward with such reserve of manner
until she saw Lady Betty&#8217;s face, then she held
out both hands, tears glistening in her eyes;
she scarcely courtesied to the duke.</p>

<p>&#8220;My child!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;my poor
child, I too have suffered so. Ah, my lord,
when will the Traitor&#8217;s Gate close, save on a
woman&#8217;s bleeding heart?&#8221; and she kissed the
young countess on brow and cheek.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>&#8220;My husband,&#8221; faltered Betty, &#8220;you know,
dear madam, that he is a Jacobite?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; Lady Russell answered sadly;
&#8220;but he is also a brave man and, as I know,
the idol of one woman&#8217;s heart. Alas, my lord,&#8221;
she added gravely to Devonshire, &#8220;do you
love us well enough to make amends for the
broken hearts&mdash;the faithful broken hearts?&#8221;</p>

<p>His Grace of Devonshire only bowed his
head while the elder sufferer clasped the younger
in her arms and caressed her, speaking kind
and soothing words, like a mother to the
daughter of her heart. A moment later, when
she glanced an inquiry at him over Betty&#8217;s
head, he shook his gravely, framing &#8220;no&#8221; with
his lips, for he had no hope, or next to none.
So he told young Mackie as they left the house
together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor young creature,&#8221; said his grace gravely,
&#8220;she shall command my utmost endeavors;
Spencer is a cold-hearted rogue&mdash;and her
father!&#8221; the duke shrugged his shoulders; &#8220;as
for Clancarty, he&#8217;s more likely to be made an
example than an exception.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a brave man, your grace,&#8221; said
Mackie generously, &#8220;and there are many of
his persuasion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A poor philosophy, my boy,&#8221; replied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
duke; &#8220;this fellow is notorious, besides. Do
you know his history?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mackie sadly, &#8220;I see only her
agony.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Ormond who introduced him to
her at Newmarket, and I suspect that his
grace knew who &#8216;Mr. Trevor&#8217; really was,
though he doesn&#8217;t admit it. But I believe she
divined it at once. Clancarty has a history,&#8221;
his grace went on; &#8220;he was bred a Protestant,
but when he went back to Ireland, in the late
king&#8217;s time, he fell in with Papist kinsfolk and
it served his turn at court to be a Papist, so
my young lord turned his coat; a wild rogue,
sir, let me tell you, yet this young girl loves
him! He sat in the Celtic Parliament at
King&#8217;s Inns,&mdash;a very pretty recommendation
to King William,&mdash;he commanded a regiment
in King James&#8217;s army and was taken by Marlborough,
but succeeded in getting off. The
estates of Clancarty&mdash;they are held to be
worth ten thousand a year&mdash;are confiscated, and
you know who has the greater share?&#8221; added
the duke significantly, &#8220;my Lord Woodstock.
William will not despoil his Dutch favorites
for a Jacobite.&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Mackie&#8217;s face was grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;She asks only for his life,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
pleads so eloquently that I think no man but
one of stone can refuse her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Devonshire smiled broadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not you, at least, my dear sir,&#8221; he replied,
&#8220;if my eyes mistake not.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man turned crimson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your grace,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I do confess it;
but I have seen her so like an angel in her devotion,
so forgetful of all but him, that, loving
her, I would risk my life to give him back to
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The duke took a pinch of snuff and stood
tapping the jewelled lid of the box thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;A very pretty sentiment, Sir Edward,&#8221; he
said genially, &#8220;and I honor you for it. By
my faith, I would not risk my own heart
against her tears, or her smiles, either,&#8221; he added
smiling, &#8220;though you need not mention it. But
I have small hope, sir, small hope; the king
has been, as we know, over merciful and fostered
rebellion at his very door. What is it the
great bard says?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">&#8220;&#8216;What doth cherish weeds but gentle air?</div>
<div class="verse">And what make robbers bold but too much lenity?&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And at this time, after the recent troubles,
his majesty is not like to be advised to mercy,&#8221;
and his grace shook his head; &#8220;there is but
little hope!&#8221;</p>

<p class="ph3">LADY RUSSELL</p>


<p class="drop-cap">IT happened that Lady Russell advised
delay in the appeal to the king; she
wished to wait for the results of the interview
between his majesty and the three dukes.
Surely no fair woman ever won greater mediators
as quickly as did poor Lady Betty.</p>

<p>Lady Russell hoped little, however, from
their efforts, though she said not a word of
this to the distracted young wife but, instead,
pointed out the advantages of waiting until
they could appeal to William quite alone&mdash;as
two women in distress&mdash;and with no connection
with any political embroglio. Indeed, the
older woman knew the king well enough to be
sure that his heart might be touched by a
woman&#8217;s grief, though in affairs of state he
could be adamant. In spite of Betty&#8217;s impatience
and misery, they waited, and Devonshire,
Ormond, and Bedford, two great English peers
and the greatest Irish one, went up to Kensington
to save one young woman&#8217;s heart from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
breaking, caring little enough for the Jacobite
earl himself.</p>

<p>It was during this season of delay, when
despair and hope were mingled, that one of
Devonshire&#8217;s gentlemen brought a packet from
the Tower and gave it to Lady Clancarty with
much elaborate courtesy. And she? She
fled with it to her room&mdash;Lady Russell had
insisted upon keeping her under her own roof&mdash;and
she kissed and wept over it, before she
opened it, although she knew that the Governor
of the Tower had read it all before her,
hard necessity!</p>

<p>It contained a ring, a letter, and the dried
sprig of shamrock, and her eyes were half
blinded with tears as she tried to read.</p>

<p>&#8220;My own dear wife,&#8221; it ran, &#8220;a gentleman
from my Lord of Devonshire has just been
with me and has told me of your noble devotion
to me in this dark hour, of your efforts in
my behalf. Dear heart, dear heart, how can I
write all I feel, or tell my gratitude to the
great duke for befriending you? To tell the
truth, I have little hope that my pardon can
be obtained, but I do hope and pray to see you
once more! Ah, the separation, Betty, I did
not know how hard it would be to bear&mdash;doubly
hard now that I know you suffer, too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
Bear up, brave heart, under the despair also;
indeed, I know you will, for my sake, and
afterwards&mdash;you will go to see my mother,
who is, I know, broken hearted&mdash;and you
will comfort her for me. Ah, I did not mean
to write to you sadly, sweetheart, but the loss
of you drives me to distraction. I see you
constantly as you looked unconscious in my
arms, and it wrings my heart. Dear love, I
send you my ring and our bit of shamrock,
and I will not believe that I shall not see you
again&mdash;&#8217;twould be too cruel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear heart, sweet wife,&mdash;farewell!&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Lady Betty, she wept over it and
caressed it like a living thing, for he had
touched it; and she hid the shamrock and
the ring in her bosom.</p>

<p>In this distracted state she waited forty-eight
hours longer, until she knew that the
three dukes had obtained no definite promise
from the king and that the Earl of Sunderland,
who was supposed to command his majesty&#8217;s
ear, was proclaiming everywhere his approval
of Spencer&#8217;s deed. The cloud grew darker
rather than brighter, and in her agony she
would have gone alone to Kensington, for
Lady Russell&#8217;s caution seemed to her only
distracting delay.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>However, the older woman only lingered to
take her steps more surely. She drew up,
with Devonshire&#8217;s help, a formal petition to
the king, not trusting to any verbal or interrupted
statement of the case, and at last, just
when the young countess was reduced almost
to madness, she signified her readiness to
accompany her to court.</p>

<p>The king was at Kensington and the two
set out, a little before noon, in Lady Russell&#8217;s
carriage, for the palace. Betty had worn her
heart out with grief and impatience; she had
not slept and she had scarcely tasted food,
except under compulsion, and was a shadow
of herself&mdash;but still a beautiful one. Lady
Russell knew intuitively all that the younger
woman had suffered, and when they were in
the carriage, she laid her hand gently over
Betty&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I know how cruel
this delay has seemed, but, believe me, &#8217;twas for
the best. Our appeal must be quite distinct
from that of the three dukes, and it must be
only from our hearts&mdash;as two desolate women.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty forced herself to speak with composure.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know the king, madam,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and I do not&mdash;or, at least, only slightly and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
alas, he has ever seemed cold to me and unapproachable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You truly do not know him,&#8221; Lady Russell
rejoined gently; &#8220;I do not think, dear Lady
Clancarty, that a great man is ever heartless,
and this man is great.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty, who looked at the Dutch king with
thoroughly English eyes, raised her brows expressively
but said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; continued, the older woman, looking
thoughtfully out of the carriage window, &#8220;after
awhile the English people will do him justice.
What other man could have held the coalition
of European powers together against France?
or could have raised England from the degradation
into which his uncles had plunged
her to her present dignity?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Betty sighed wearily; her heart was
in the Tower.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that I have heard him called the
arbiter of Europe,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;but he is so
very Dutch, dear Lady Russell, and so stern
and cold in his way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not cold,&#8221; said Lady Russell, &#8220;but merciful.
His uncle James was cold&mdash;look at
the pleading of Monmouth, &#8217;twould have
moved a heart of stone&mdash;and Charles was
often cruel.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>&#8220;Alas! King William may turn as deaf an
ear to me,&#8221; cried the young countess, with a
quivering voice; &#8220;was ever fate more cruel?
If he is beheaded I shall die!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Russell said nothing, but gave her so
eloquent a look that Betty broke down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;oh, forgive me!
How selfish grief makes us; I forgot&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I lived,&#8221; said the widow quietly.</p>

<p>Betty fell to weeping silently.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twould be worse to live!&#8221; she moaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is worse,&#8221; retorted Lady Russell; &#8220;grief
eats into the heart like a canker; but I lived
for his son!&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty&#8217;s head went lower down; sobs shook
her from head to foot. The older woman put
her arm around her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I know, but we are
going to a great man&mdash;a great king. Dear
child, let us hope. You do not know King
William. Melancholy and personal misfortunes
seem to be wrapped in the birthright of the
Stuarts, but, ah, my dear, this man is descended
also from the house of that great prince who
set Holland free. Mercy belongs, of right, to
mighty princes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I love a great man,&#8221; said Betty, drying
her tears.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>&#8220;So do all women,&#8221; replied Lady Russell;
&#8220;it is born in us; we do not love littleness
or weakness. This is a very solemn matter
and we may not judge the king, or judge for
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Clancarty did not reply, she could not;
she was struggling to conquer her emotions,
to prepare herself for the coming interview,
and Lady Russell took her hand and held it
in silent sympathy.</p>

<p>The agony of that hour of suspense was
almost too much to bear; her husband&#8217;s life
hanging in the balance, at the will of this stern,
silent man; this man who seemed to her&mdash;as
he did to many of the English, an unsympathetic,
phlegmatic Dutchman&mdash;an alien in the
land.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yonder is the palace,&#8221; remarked Lady
Russell, in a strangely quiet voice, though her
hand clasped tightly over Betty&#8217;s.</p>

<p>They both looked out on the palace and the
green before it, the barrack buildings and the
gates, at which a dozen or more emblazoned
coaches waited, and they could see the sun
flash on the arms of the guards within and
without the gates.</p>

<p>The girl drew her breath sharply; she shook
from head to foot.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>&#8220;Ah, madam,&#8221; she cried wildly, &#8220;if he says&mdash;&#8216;no&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Russell bowed her head, her lips
moved; her thoughts went back to the dreadful
days of the Rye House Plot; she thought
of herself beside her husband at his trial, of his
last hours; she seemed to see him in the coach,
driven almost past his home on his way to die
in Lincoln&#8217;s Inn Fields. She shuddered, too,
but in a moment her serene sadness returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must put our trust in the King of
kings,&#8221; she said gently, clasping her hands and
looking upward.</p>

<p>Betty wept silently; at that moment every
hope seemed to die in her heart.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the coach rolled heavily and
surely as fate itself along the High Street of
Kensington, and at last through the palace
gates.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">THE KING</p>


<p class="drop-cap">KENSINGTON PALACE was an offence
in those days to English eyes.
The burning of Whitehall had furnished
William with the opportunity to escape,
not only from the air of London, which
aggravated his asthma, but also from the crowd
of sycophants who choked the galleries of the
city palace. Long muddy roads and exorbitant
charges for conveyance made it no easy matter
for the spendthrift courtier and the needy
adventurer to torment the king at Kensington.
He was as well pleased at the escape as they
were disgruntled; but even here they could
pursue him with annoyances.</p>

<p>The malcontents in Parliament had stripped
him of his beloved Dutch guards, and in their
stead the Life Guards saluted at his threshold.</p>

<p>It was through a file of these gay gentlemen
that Betty passed with Lady Russell, and they
stared not a little at the lovely face of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
young countess, though they received both
with every token of respect and courtesy.
Lady Russell was, indeed, a well-known and
honored guest at the palace, and they were
conducted by an officer of the household to
the anteroom of the king&#8217;s presence chamber,
there to await his pleasure.</p>

<p>The long room was already filled with
visitors of almost every degree, come upon
various errands, and Lady Clancarty found it
no light thing to face the ill-disguised curiosity
and admiration that assailed her on all sides.</p>

<p>Here was a peer, in the splendid dress of
the court, glittering with jewels and gold lace,
curled and perfumed and ruffled; here a
plainly dressed shrewd fellow, with a bundle
of papers, a clerk from the foreign office, for
the king was his own minister of foreign
affairs; there was a richly dressed magnate of
the city, with an eye on the interests of the
East India Company; there an eager applicant
for office; and farther off, a despairing petitioner
who glanced in open sympathy at Lady
Clancarty.</p>

<p>A king&#8217;s anteroom! How many secret
histories are written here; what comedy,
what tragedy!</p>

<p>The low murmur of talk rose and fell;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
great ladies, powdered and patched, swept their
furbelows through the crowd and swayed their
fans, chattering lightly of a hundred things;
great lords bowed and smiled and took snuff
and cursed the king, in their hearts, for keeping
them waiting. A pair of lovers, two young
things, were cooing in a window recess, as
indifferent to the public as a pair of turtledoves,
and Betty looked at them with dull
eyes. The wait seemed to be for hours, and
the heated atmosphere and the flutter of talk
almost suffocated her. She looked up and
saw the door open and her father coming out
of the king&#8217;s closet, pleased, smiling, courteous
to all, greeting them right and left, bowing
here, extending a hand there. Betty felt that
he saw her, but he averted his face and she
stepped back into the window recess near at
hand and opened the sash; she could not
breathe. While she stood there his Grace of
Devonshire came up and had a few words
with Lady Russell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any hope?&#8221; her ladyship asked
sadly, with a meaning glance aside at the
young figure in its plain black garb.</p>

<p>His grace shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see none,&#8221; he replied, very low; &#8220;there
has been such a demand for examples; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
people are so tired of these conspiracies, and
they are like to class Clancarty with the worst.
You know the king, that reserve of his betrays
nothing, but I think I never saw him less
inclined to mercy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Russell&#8217;s face became intensely grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall do all I can,&#8221; she said, &#8220;my utmost.
Poor young thing, her heart is
breaking!&#8221;</p>

<p>The duke cast a look of deep concern
toward Lady Clancarty and shook his head
again. The next moment he smiled, as she
turned to them, smiled and kissed her hand as
an open sign of his sympathy and support.
She said nothing; she only looked searchingly
into his eyes and her lips quivered. Would it
be much longer?</p>

<p>The talk rose and fell; some woman
laughed, the shallow cackling laugh that comes
from the empty heart and the empty head;
the crackling of thorns under a pot.</p>

<p>An usher bowed before Lady Russell and
she held out her hand to Betty. The duke
smiled again reassuringly; and the two women
walked slowly through the throng, passed in
at a low doorway, and in a moment there was
stillness.</p>

<p>They had entered a low-ceiled room, lighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
by one large window; it was plainly but richly
furnished and near a table strewn with papers
stood a small, thin man. He was dressed in
black velvet, with a ruffled cravat of Mechlin
and a star on his breast; he wore a great curled
periwig. Insignificant in size but with a wonderful
majesty of bearing; the king of three
kingdoms and the stadt-holder of Hollander&mdash;William
of Orange.</p>

<p>As they entered he turned and stood looking
at them. His complexion was a clear, pale
olive; his eagle nose and brilliant eyes immediately
commanding attention, with something,
too, in the cold majesty of his mien and the
habitual sadness of his expression. His face,
narrow at the chin, expanded widely at the
brows, and his glance was singularly luminous.
His eyes a clear hazel, with a depth to them
like the clear brown of some mountain pool
undisturbed by any ripple upon the surface,
deep and transparent; his thin figure was
inclined to stoop, and he had a racking cough,
left behind by smallpox.</p>

<p>He greeted Lady Russell and the young
countess with perfect courtesy, but his reserve
remained as icy as ever, and like a cloak about
him; warm-hearted Betty shivered, stricken
silent.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>&#8220;Sire, we come to you as humble suppliants,&#8221;
Lady Russell said, &#8220;to pray you to
graciously receive our petition. I need not
tell your majesty that this is Lord Sunderland&#8217;s
daughter, the unhappy wife of the Earl of
Clancarty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My Lords of Devonshire and Ormond
have already told me,&#8221; the king said, coughing
a little as he cast a thoughtful look at the young
countess; &#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; he added, &#8220;that it
is so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, sire, have mercy on us both,&#8221; murmured
Lady Betty, finding her tongue at last;
&#8220;to you belongs the glory of mercy. Spare
him, your majesty, he came here only to see
me&mdash;to see his wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>The king did not reply, but took the petition
from Lady Russell and laid it on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me plead for her, sire,&#8221; said the widow
gently, &#8220;I need not remind your majesty that
I have suffered as she is suffering. I knelt to
plead for life to King Charles, as she kneels
now to King William, and I knelt in vain.
They carried my husband&mdash;almost past his
own home&mdash;to his death and I&mdash;ah, my
king, I lived! That is the terror of it, and
the cruelty; you cannot divine it,&mdash;&#8217;tis
martyrdom!&#8221; the widow&#8217;s voice was shaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
by the agony of recollection and for the moment
she could say no more. &#8220;I pray you
humbly, if I have ever served your majesty or
deserved well at your hands, to consider our
petition. We ask but life&mdash;all else we leave
in your hands. Let us remind you, sire, that
of all the qualities that most adorn your gracious
character that of mercy has ever shone
conspicuous, has won the hearts of your
people&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>William held up his hand with a bitter smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say no more, madam,&#8221; he interrupted ironically;
&#8220;&#8217;tis not often that I am reminded of
my conquest of the hearts of the English
people!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Betty threw herself on her knees before
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sire,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I pray for mercy&mdash;for
life! Ah, think, your majesty, the day must
come when you, too, will look for mercy&mdash;and
I am sure your pity for us now will comfort
you then. I only ask my husband&#8217;s life&mdash;his
life!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice broke pitifully; how little she
could say! Agony ties the tongue; she looked
up through her tears and wrung her hands
together with a gesture of despair, an appeal
more eloquent than words.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>&#8220;O gracious sovereign,&#8221; she murmured
faintly, &#8220;life&mdash;life! That is my cry to you&mdash;only
spare him to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>A cough racked the king, and for the moment
he was silent. Lady Russell trembled
for the effect of the appeal. He raised the
countess kindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My child,&#8221; he said, &#8220;these matters are
not always as much at the king&#8217;s disposal as
they seem; you forget my parliament;&#8221; a dry
smile flickered across his face; &#8220;I can make
you no unconditional promise until I have
considered your petition, and those of others
in this matter. Your husband has been a conspicuous
offender, but if I can save him&mdash;&#8221;
he broke off, closing his lips tightly, his face
singularly stern and sad.</p>

<p>Betty thought he had yielded and began to
pour out her thanks weeping, but the king
held up his hand coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can make no unconditional promise,&#8221; he
repeated dryly, &#8220;reserve your thanks until
there is a certainty&mdash;but,&#8221; he added, after a
moment&#8217;s hesitation, &#8220;think not hardly hereafter
of your Dutch king.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty turned crimson and William gave Lady
Russell a significant glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your husband is an old offender, Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
Clancarty,&#8221; he added, with his rasping little
cough; &#8220;he not only fought in Ireland but he
sat in that parliament at King&#8217;s Inns, and there
are others who might base a claim for indemnity
upon any clemency that he received.
But rest assured,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;that the
king has as much feeling as any other man&mdash;and
heavier sorrows.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gently and kindly dismissed them, but
Betty having gone half way across the room
ran back, as impulsive as any child, and
kneeling on one knee kissed his hand, and
then ran out weeping, as unmindful of etiquette
as a country lass.</p>

<p>On the stairs she looked up through her
tears at Lady Russell.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand you now,&#8221; she said, deeply
moved; &#8220;I felt his greatness&mdash;he is a king!
But, oh, will he be merciful? Will he spare
my poor husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Russell could not answer; she turned
her face aside. She felt that the king had
given them so little hope, that his answer had
been enigmatical. She took Betty&#8217;s hand again,
but neither of them could speak; and in silence
they went home to the house in Bloomsbury.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIII</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">DONOUGH!</p>


<p class="drop-cap">THE night of suspense&mdash;longer than
a year of happiness&mdash;wore to an end,
because all things end. At noon
Lady Betty stood in Lady Russell&#8217;s drawing-room,
leaning against the window and looking
out, so wan and wasted that her hostess started
at the sight of her as she entered. The two
women greeted each other with an affection
born of sympathy, in spite of their brief
acquaintance, and as they stood there with
clasped hands, they heard the clatter of hoofs
in the street below, a noise at the door, steps
on the stair.</p>

<p>Betty uttered a cry and stood rigid; it had
come, good or ill! The door was flung open
and Devonshire&#8217;s messenger, plashed with mire
from hard riding, bowed at the threshold, holding
up a letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;From his grace to Lady Russell,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Lady Russell tore it open with shaking
hands but Betty did not stir; she stood like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
a statue; she thought her heart had stopped
beating. The older woman clasped the paper
to her bosom, murmuring a thanksgiving.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is saved!&#8221; she cried joyfully, holding
out the letter to Lady Clancarty, &#8220;your husband
is saved! The king grants his life, but
exiles him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Betty swayed and would have fallen
but for her friend. The good woman caught
her in her arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;That merciful king!&#8221; cried Lady Russell,
tears streaming down her face; &#8220;ah, if I had
been so blessed!&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty flung her arms around her neck and
kissed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go to the Tower!&#8221; she cried
eagerly, after a moment, &#8220;I may go now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, madam,&#8221; interposed the duke&#8217;s messenger
respectfully, &#8220;his grace did especially
charge me to beg you to remain here until he
came for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said Lady Russell, glancing at the
letter, &#8220;he speaks of it here.&#8221;</p>

<p>A shade of deep disappointment crossed the
youthful face, but she bowed her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall await the duke&#8217;s pleasure,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>After the messenger withdrew, Lady Russell
touched her friend&#8217;s frock playfully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; she remarked, &#8220;you will not
go to welcome him back to the world in this
sombre garb?&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty glanced down dolefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I brought no other,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>Lady Russell smiled and sent for Alice.</p>

<p>&#8220;My child,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I heard this morning
that there was strong hope&mdash;yet I dared
not tell you, for fear of disappointment. But
I sent Alice for a gayer gown than this for your
lover.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty blushed like a rose, for in walked
Alice, carrying in her arms the flowered brocade
that her mistress had worn at Newmarket,
and Alice was all smiles and tears. Nothing
would do but that Lady Russell and Alice
must array her as for a festival.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the Tower!&#8221; protested Betty, between
tears and laughter, trembling and listening
for a sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;For your husband,&#8221; whispered Lady Russell,
kissing her cheek, &#8220;the king has granted
you a pension sufficient for you on the Continent&mdash;alas,
that you must go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but with him,&#8221; said Lady Betty smiling
divinely.</p>

<p>It was while they talked that Alice came by
chance upon Denis on the staircase; Denis was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
smiling like a cherub. He stood before her
awkwardly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faix,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I was afther thinking ye
a sneak, my darlint, but, shure, I misjudged
ye,&#8221; he paused, shuffling his feet with unfamiliar
shyness in his aspect, while Alice eyed
him with prim disapproval.</p>

<p>&#8220;My darlint,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m afther makin&#8217;
some aminds fer th&#8217; batin&#8217;; will&mdash;will ye be
Mrs. Dinis now?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Alice withered him with a look.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no need of ill will, my darlint,&#8221;
he continued nervously; &#8220;faix, I know a man
that always bates his wife whin his affection
overcomes him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know me!&#8221; exclaimed Alice
indignantly, red as a poppy.</p>

<p>Denis, not a whit abashed, would have
caught her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nathing in th&#8217; wurrld to kape us
from gittin&#8217; acquainted, me love,&#8221; he said
gallantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Deliver me from a bloody Papist!&#8221; said
Alice piously, escaping up the stair and leaving
Denis grinning openly in his relief, for he had
contemplated a noble sacrifice of his own
feelings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lady Russell and the countess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
had descended to the drawing-room again to
await my Lord of Devonshire&#8217;s arrival. Like
a rose, Betty had bloomed out with joy, radiant
in her beautiful gown, trembling and impatient.
She paced the floor, Lady Russell watching her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; she said, &#8220;why can I not go at once
to the Tower? &#8217;Tis so hard to wait!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The duke would go with you,&#8221; Lady Russell
replied quietly, &#8220;and it is best so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has been so good to me&mdash;to us!&#8221;
Betty murmured, a break in her voice.</p>

<p>She was thinking of her father&#8217;s averted face,
her brother&#8217;s cruelty, her tittering, painted,
heartless mother. &#8220;He is kinder than my
own blood,&#8221; she said, &#8220;he and the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He remembered even the pension,&#8221; Lady
Russell assented, &#8220;that good king!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Lady Betty scarcely heard her; she
strained her ears to catch far other sounds.
The rumble of a heavy coach, the closing of a
door, steps in the hall. She fled to the top of
the staircase, like a startled bird, and looked
down; through a window beside her the sun
shone in. There were many below, my Lord
of Devonshire, a stately figure, the Duke of
Ormond, young Sir Edward Mackie, half a
dozen gentlemen. But she did not see them;
what were they to her?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>She saw a tall figure, a handsome, eager face,
as Clancarty sprang up the stairs.</p>

<p>Lady Betty held out her arms, the sun
shining in her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Donough!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;my own true
love!&#8221;</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
